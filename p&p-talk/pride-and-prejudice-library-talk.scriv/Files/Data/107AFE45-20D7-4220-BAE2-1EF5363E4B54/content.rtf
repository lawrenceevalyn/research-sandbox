\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Labour and work occupy a fascinating but hidden position in the makeup of Pride and Prejudice. This lecture considers the paternalistic role of the country estate holder and looks at changes to the British working world brought about by the Enclosure Acts, which turned working land into decorative land. Examining Bingley's origin in trade, Mr. Bennet's poor management of his estate and Mr. Darcy's sustainable land-use practices at Pemberley provides further insight to this theme.}

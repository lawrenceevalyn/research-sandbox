“Three hundred pounds a year (or $6,000), says Mrs. Parsons, is confining, but if accompanied by a curacy which includes a house and garden, it might support a small family.'6 Four hundred pounds a year ($8,000) is considered just right, not too much, not too little for a single woman inThe Castle of Wolfenbach (1793).”

The Militia in Jane Austen’s England
Posted on September 1, 2016 by Regina Jeffers • 16 Comments
What was the difference between the militia officers found in Regency-based novels, such as Mr. Wickham in Pride and Prejudice, and the Regulars, such as Colonel Fitzwilliam, in the same book?

At the time of the war with Napoleon, Great Britain did not employ a standing militia. They were only recruited when the Regulars were required to engage the enemy. The militia assumed the “policing” of the country in the absence of the Regulars. They served on home land. They were dispensed to squash riots and seditious actions. They protected British soil while the Regulars engaged the enemy outside of the home land. The militia was often dispatched to shires away from their homes to avoid their sympathizing with those they were charged to dispatch. In Pride and Prejudice, the militia which Mr. Wickham joins in Hertfordshire, is supposedly peppered with Derbyshire volunteers. 

“‘In the novel the anonymous regiment of – shires caused a considerable stir on its arrival in the quiet country town of Meryton – and among the Bennet family of five unmarried daughters. . . . They were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighborhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the head quarters.’ (P&amp;P 28). The regiment and its officers figure prominently in the fortunes of the Bennet family for the remainder of the novel. Jane Austen’s own experience of the militia was probably not too different from that of  the Bennet sisters. From about the age of sixteen she began to attend the monthly assemblies at the town of Basingstoke, about seven miles distant from her home village of Steventon. Here, during the winter of 1794-95, the assemblies would have been graced by officers of the South Devon Militia: three of their eight companies were quartered in Basingstoke. Their colonel was John Tolle, Member of Parliament for Devonshire since 1780, whose support for William Pitt, the Prime Minister, had made him the butt of the opposition Whigs in the mock-epic Rolliad. The officers of the South Devonshires would have enlivened local society just as the -shires did at Meryton. As they all came from the neighborhood of Exeter, it is likely that Jane Austen heard a great deal about that area from them, and it is probably not coincidence that when she wrote the beginnings of her first mature novel in the summer of 1795 about two girls called Elinor and Marianne, she set their new home, Barton, in South Devon ‘within four miles northward of Exeter’ (SAS 25).” (Breihan and Caplan: Jane Austen and the Militia)

“Pride and Prejudice takes place in Regency England during the French Revolution, which began in 1789. To combat the threat of Napoleon’s conquest of Europe, militia forces were moved across the countryside to lie in wait of an attack at camps where they were involved in training sessions. Landowning aristocrats generally led the militia of their locality, although the soldiers of each regiment came from various places. Though the militia was made up of volunteers, a commission was needed to enroll. With the Militia Act of 1757, which created a more professional force with proper uniforms and better weapons, the militia became seen as a more respectable occupation, especially for younger sons who would not inherit land.” (The Militia in “Pride and Prejudice”)

Few members of the militia were trained in military tactics, such as shooting, horsemanship, or use of a sword. They were required to have their own guns to be a member of the militia. Those picked or volunteering for militia duty in the rank and file served five years, while some served for seven years. Officer commissions were not available (as opposed to those in the Regulars). Those who held rank in the militia received that rank based on how much land the family held. Captain Denny in Pride and Prejudice would need either to be the heir of land worth at least £400 per year or actually own land worth at least £200 per year. Although we are given nothing of Denny’s background in Austen’s novel, we are told that George Wickham becomes a lieutenant in the Meryton militia. This is a bit confusing to many who know something of military history, for  a lieutenant in the militia would be required to hold land worth £50 per year. If Wickham had nothing of his own upon which to depend, how did he receive his lieutenancy? Most experts speak of a lowering of the standards for the few who would qualify as a junior officer otherwise, meaning Wickham held a gentleman’s education, making him “qualify as a junior officer.” The wages presented to the officers was only to cover their expenses, not replace their income from their land.

All Protestant males were required to be available for the militia. There was a quota for each area. A local nobleman (customarily referred to as the Lord Lieutenant) was charged “by the King” (or rather by the King’s spokesman) to gather a force of able-bodied men between the ages of 18 – 45 to serve as part of the country’s militia. A local landowner was appointed as the “colonel” in charge of the men of the unit. These men were “guaranteed” not to know service outside of the homeland, meaning they would not know the battlefield frequented by professional soldiers. They also experienced a steady social life provided by the local gentry. Only clergymen were exempt from this duty.

There were substantial signing bonuses during the wars as the militia, Regulars and volunteers competed for the same pool of men, so anyone from outside the county would and did join the militia for the bonus and pay. Parishes were fined if they did not raise the required numbers of militiamen, so they were happy to have anyone fill the rosters, paying a bonus that was far less than the fine. And of course, sooner or later the parishes and Regular army learned not to  pay the bonuses before the men were marched away. More than a few made a living by receiving the bonuses and then skipping out, only to ‘enlist’ again someplace else for bonuses there. A man who did not wish to serve could pay another to serve in his stead. They were offered between £25 and  £60, which was equivalent to a year’s wage for many in the Regency. 

Our own Collins Hemingway tells us, “Clergy were not actually “exempt” from being in the Militia. Some people, however, felt it improper for a man of the cloth to bear arms. The Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire seems to have been of that view, which is why Jane’s brother, James, did not formally serve in the Militia or the Volunteers even though he helped recruit about 100 men from four parishes to serve in the Volunteers. Likewise, his father, Mr. Austen, recruited 35 men of the Steventon parish for the Militia. The Volunteers were a separate organization, which came into being when fear of an invasion was at its peak. They would have been the last line of defense had Napoleon invaded.”

As part of the community, as well as the neighborhood, there was a certain sense of pomp and circumstance as part of the militia. They would conduct military reviews (much as we see in reenactments today). This would include close order marching, marksmanship contests, and even staged “fights” for the entertainment of the neighborhood. 

In any case, when Napoleon returned from Elba, the militia were called up and regular army volunteers were asked for from the militia, both officers and men. A number went to Belgium, but the militias were held in readiness on the coasts during and after Waterloo. After Waterloo, there was an effort to stop the surge in smugglers and ex-patriots trying to escape a now Monarchial France, landing along the English coasts. 

Because of the militia riots of 1813, militias were more often kept in the county of origin in small groups across the countryside. Most Regular Army units were not disbanded or reduced until the fall of 1816, so the militia would not have been sent to their homes until about the same time, depending on the mood of the county folks and the coastal activity.

We must recall that what we term as the “Napoleonic Wars” is a twenty year period, 1792-1815. There were several kinds of militia during this time, including yeomanry, fensible, and volunteer organizations. The threat of invasion and the desperate need for manpower in the Regular army also affected how and where militia were used. There were very few barracks at all at the start of the Napoleonic wars, better than 85% of the ones existing for militia and Regular troops in 1815 were built during the wars. And then there are the various militia revolts which colored the way militia was deployed in later years.

Robert Cordery says, “During the Napoleonic Wars the Militia became a source of recruits (both officers and men) for the Regular Army, and quite a few served with Wellington’s army in Spain. The differences between the Fencibles (hostilities-only Regulars who could only serve within the UK), the Militia (usually part-time Infantry who could be embodied (called up for full-time service in time of emergency) to served within the UK), and Yeomanry (the mounted equivalent of the Militia) are sometimes blurred. For example, some of the coastal fortifications were partially manned by Fencibles and Invalids (the latter being pensioned Regulars recalled to the Colours) with additional personnel coming from the local Militia.”

Austen began Pride and Prejudice about 1796 and did not publish it until 1813, sixteen years later, so the when of the book and the militia being stationed in her area  likely changed quite often based on training for several different reasons… and types of militia. 

“Reading Pride and Prejudice, one may notice that there is a conspicuous lack of war in the text despite the historical context of the Napoleonic Wars and the near-constant presence of the militia. The soldiers Austen depicts are more likely to play card games or dance rather than tell tales of bloodshed, partly because the militia received few chances to fight. The aristocrats that led each local militia tended to be corrupt as well, handing out promotions in exchange for money or sexual bribes. Lydia’s fantasies exemplify the moral laxity of the militia; she imagines ‘the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers… She saw all the glories of the camp; its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once’ (262). Lydia’s description reveals the militia’s superficial attractions, one of which is novelty–the militia are still a new enough presence in England to appear young and gay and dazzling in their uniforms rather than war-weary. Undercurrents of sexuality run through Lydia’s fantasy in her image of “herself seated… tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.” Although Lydia’s vision seems romantic enough, sexual deviance was a prominent spectacle of military life. Soldiers invited their mistresses into their tents at night and several prominent aristocrats such as the Duke of York were involved in highly publicized sex scandals. 

“Added to the immorality that a military life offered was the anonymity and respectable status, which allowed men to climb social ranks easily. Due to the constant movement of the militia across the country, the new regimentals a man wore, and his new title as an officer, he could escape the hold of his past. Tim Fulford explores this idea in his essay ‘Sighing for a Soldier,’ writing that ‘[a soldier’s] dress and rank might well have been earned not by experience on the battlefield or parade ground but by influence, and the shiny uniforms masked a variety of characters and origins’ (Fulford 157). The idea that ‘influence’ can earn a man status is not new to England, a country in which the aristocracy thrive off of patronage,  and in the militia ‘influence’ took the form of underhanded bribes and secret deals among officers. ‘[S]hiny uniforms and the opulence and novelty of militia camps mostly covered up this corruption from the public; however, corruption on such large a scale could never be wholly hidden.'” (The Militia in “Pride and Prejudice”)

Lord Lieutenants were very important men in a county. There was only one per county ( shire). They had many duties as representative of the crown . One of the duties was maintaining law and order. Another was raising the militia. Most of the lord Lieutenants were large landowners.
The article was interesting. As for corruption– patronage was the way of life. Mr. Austen, James, Henry, Charles and Frank all benefited from patronage. Mr. Austen wouldn’t have been able to marry without the gift of the living from a relative.
I much prefer a man in clothes, especially a uniform to one who has torn his shirt to pieces to appear half naked in inappropriate places.

I am glad you found this useful, Summer. The question arises as to whom Darcy paid to serve in his stead. Would that not make a good story line if the person he paid was Wickham? “cackles deviously*

Pounds and Dollars in Jane Austen’s World:
 
An Addendum to “How Wealthy is
Mr. Darcy – Really?” (Persuasions #12)
 
JAMES HELDMAN

Bowling Green, KY 42101
 
When a lady asked Dr. Johnson why, in his A Dictionary of the English Language, he defined “pastern” as “the knee of an horse,” he replied, “Ignorance, Madam, pure ignorance.”  I make no pretensions to the wisdom and knowledge of Dr. Johnson, but I can do no less than emulate his candor.  In my paper on pounds and dollars in Jane Austen’s world (Persuasions 12), I said that fabric seems to have been more expensive in her day than today.  Alas, it was even more expensive than I realized.  Melissa Ennis of Arlington, Virginia, who describes herself as “an historic costume maven,” has graciously written to enlighten me and all of us on the subject.  She tells me that in 1810 fabric was typically sold in 24” to 36” widths; today it is 45” to 60” wide.  Thus fabric was at least twice as expensive in Jane Austen’s time as it is today and perhaps even more.  I simply didn’t know about the difference in fabric widths.  But the information lends even more support to my contention that the evidence doesn’t suggest that consumer goods were significantly less expensive in Jane Austen’s day than in our own.  Thanks, Melissa!</Text>

How Wealthy is Mr. Darcy – Really?
Pounds and Dollars in the World of
Pride and Prejudice

This paper was originally presented at the 1989 AGM in Santa Fe and is printed here with only minor modification.  Pound-dollar equivalents and consumer prices change slightly every year, but normally only slightly.  There may be some disagreement about how pound-dollar equivalents should be calculated, but I am advised that the method employed here should be considered conservative.
 
Money matters to everyone – to avid readers of Jane Austen as well as to normal people.  It certainly mattered to Jane Austen herself.  Her novels and her letters are liberally peppered with references to money.  Characters are defined by their incomes and fortunes as much as they are by their appearances and their manners.  Suitors are eligible or not in part because of their incomes.  Jane Austen was not so cynical as to believe that money could ensure happiness, but she was enough of a realist to understand that a sufficient income was vital to any marriage and that a good or even ideal marriage would be enhanced immeasurably by a substantial fortune.  Though she attempted, unsuccessfully, to remain anonymous as a novelist, she was very attentive to the reception of her works, and she kept a precise account of her income from her writing.
The problem is what these frequent references to nineteenth-century British currency in Jane Austen’s novels and letters mean in terms of U.S. dollars today.  What is their tangible, meaningful value for American readers in the latter half of the twentieth century?  It is a question that I have been curious about for some time and one that I believe I have found a reasonably satisfactory answer to.  I have consulted with an authority, a colleague in the Department of Economics at my university, and in the best tradition of collegiality, he has provided me with a table with which to convert British currency for every decade since 1800 to current (1988) U.S. dollars (Table 1).  The process of conversion, which I am assured is a sound and generally accepted one among economists, begins with the exchange rate for each decade.  When the exchange rate is adjusted for inflation by using the U.S. Consumer Price Index with 1988 as 100, it is then possible to calculate the 1988 U.S. dollar equivalent for the British pound sterling in each decade.  In addition, by using a variety of historical statistics, it is possible to determine the per capita income in U.S. dollars for each decade and to convert that also into 1988 U.S. dollars.  Admittedly, though I am assured the figures are solid, they do not and cannot take entirely into account some variables – in particular, the gradual shift from a largely rural, non-currency-based economy at the beginning of the nineteenth century to an increasingly urban, currency-based economy as we move through the nineteenth century and through most of the twentieth.  Nevertheless, these figures can, I believe, give us a much clearer, though still approximate, sense of what money then means as money now.  The year I will focus on is, of course, 1810, and the 1988 U.S. dollar equivalent for that year is $33.13.  Another important detail to keep in mind is that the U.S. per capita income in 1810 was $821 in 1988 U.S. dollars.  However, since the per capita income in England at the beginning of the nineteenth century was about 20% higher than in the U.S., we can estimate it roughly at $1,000.  Those two details – the 1988 U.S. dollar equivalent for the British per capita income in 1810 – can, I believe, give us a somewhat clearer sense of what money means in the world of Pride and Prejudice.
Mr. Darcy is not the wealthiest of Jane Austen’s characters.  That honor belongs, as far as we can determine, to Mr. Rushworth in Mansfield Park; and it may belong to Sir Thomas Bertram, though we are never told what his income is.  Nevertheless, Mr. Darcy is very wealthy.  He has an income of £10,000 a year; if we multiply that by $33.13, then we see that Mr. Darcy has an income of well over $300,000 a year.  On the face of it, that hardly makes him Lee Iacocca.  But Mr. Darcy’s income is at least 300 times the per capita income in his day.  Moreover, Mr. Darcy belongs to a very select group.  G.E. Mingay, an economic historian, estimates that in 1790, about twenty years before the time of Pride and Prejudice, there were only 400 families among the landed gentry in England whose incomes fell within that range, a range from £5,000 to £50,000 a year, with the average being £10,000 a year.  Mr. Darcy is thus the average among what Mingay describes as the “Great Landlords” (26).  The magnitude of his income may also be further understood when seen in relation to other incomes of the day.  In 1795, the income of a “leading merchant or banker” was only £2,000 a year (McGrandle 73).  Thus it is easy to understand why Mrs. Bennet is flustered when she learns of her daughter’s coming marriage.  Elizabeth will no doubt be comfortable.  Mr. Bingley has inherited £100,000 – something over $3,000,000 – from his father, and his income is half Mr. Darcy’s – £5,000 or about $165,000 a year.  Mr. Bennet, however, is not so wealthy, with an income of only £2,000 or a little over $65,000 a year; and though he owns his estate, at least for his lifetime, and no doubt gets most of the family food from his own farms, he must satisfy the needs of five daughters and a silly wife.  One measure of the cost of those needs is Mr. Bennet’s response to the requirement that he settle £100 a year on Lydia as part of the arrangements for her marriage to Wickham.  We are told:
 
He would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the hundred that was to be paid to them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her, through her mother’s hands, Lydia’s expences had been very little within that sum.  (P&amp;P, 309)
 
So for Mr. Bennet the cost of maintaining one teen-age daughter is roughly $3,300 a year.  If we assume that the requirements of his other daughters are approximately the same – and they may not all be as expensive as Lydia – then his daughters cost him £500 or $16,500 a year, and he still has £1500 or almost $49,700 to devote to his wife, his library, and the other accoutrements of modestly gracious living.
The future prospects for Mrs. Bennet and the girls, in the event of Mr. Bennet’s death, are, as Mrs. Bennet fully understands early in the novel, rather bleak by comparison.  Mrs. Bennet has inherited £4,000 from her father, an attorney in Meryton, and £5,000 has been settled on her and her children by marriage articles, to be divided among her and the children as the parents wish.  Assuming that Mrs. Bennet has not spent any of her inheritance – perhaps a questionable assumption – and assuming that Mrs. Bennet’s worst fears are realized and none of her daughters marry, the six of them would have a modest fortune of £9,000.  Invested in five per cent government bonds, this would bring them an income of £450 a year – almost $15,000 – less than one-fourth of what they had been accustomed to at Longbourn.  Of course, things don’t turn out that way.  Mr. Bennet is required to settle on Lydia her portion – the portion unspecified – of that £5,000 at the time of her marriage to Wickham.  Both Jane and Elizabeth marry extremely well and have no need of their shares.  In view of the financial circumstances of two of her daughters, I think we may assume that Mrs. Bennet would be well taken care of in any eventuality – and even that she might continue to slip Lydia a few pounds from time to time.
Wickham is also an interesting case for financial examination.  He had been left £1,000 – slightly over $33,000 – by Mr. Darcy’s father.  Subsequently, he received an additional £3,000 – almost $100,000 – from Mr. Darcy in return for his giving up any further claim to the Darcy church living, and thus Mr. Darcy felt himself absolved of any further obligation to him.  But as we learn, Wickham is a spendthrift, a ne’er-do-well, a welcher, and a gamester – Mr. Darcy must settle more than £1,000 of Wickham’s debts – over $33,000 – before he will agree to marry Lydia.  Though we can hardly approve, we can at least understand how someone with his spending habits would be tempted to plot an elopement with Georgiana Darcy, whose fortune of £30,000 – almost $1,000,000 – is equal to that of Emma Woodhouse.  Georgiana is, as Alistair Duckworth has observed of Emma, “a bona fide heiress in Jane Austen’s financial scale” (148).  No one else would be well served by Wickham’s marriage to Georgiana, but Wickham, with his tastes and habits, certainly would be.
Money in Pride and Prejudice is primarily a measure of relative wealth and security.  But in Sense and Sensibility, the most financially complex of Jane Austen’s novels, money seems to function in other ways as well.  Attitudes toward money in Sense and Sensibility serve at least two additional purposes.  They give us insights into the values and tastes of some of the characters, and they help us to understand something of what an adequate income would be in Jane Austen’s time.  Alistair Duckworth estimates that John Dashwood’s income is £5,000 to £6,000 a year (86) – $165,000 to $198,000 – and thus he is even wealthier than Mr. Bingley.  Nevertheless, he decides not to allow his mother and her daughters either £100 or £50 a year, even though their combined income is only £500 a year.  Obviously, John Dashwood is an avaricious tightwad, selfish, self-indulgent, and ungenerous in the highest degree.  Willoughby’s estate at Combe Magna, according to Sir John Middleton, brings him about £600 a year – almost $20,000 – but because of his debts and the uncertainty of his inheritance from Mrs. Smith, he chooses to become engaged to Miss Grey, who has a fortune of £50,000, and, incidentally, is the wealthiest of Jane Austen’s heiresses whose fortunes are specifically identified.  Her fortune, invested in the five per cents, would bring her £2,500 a year which, coupled with Willoughby’s £600, gives them a total income of £3,100 – almost $103,000.  It would seem that even Willoughby’s most expensive tastes could well be satisfied by that amount and that his motives are entirely mercenary.  He might even be seen as an early study for Wickham, at least in that regard.  On the other hand, Edward Ferrars has the opportunity to become reasonably wealthy as well.  Were he to comply with his mother’s wishes and become engaged to Miss Morton and her £30,000, he would receive £1,000 a year from his mother, £1500 a year from Miss Morton’s fortune invested in the five per cents, and the £100 that his own £2,000 would yield, bringing his income to £2,600 a year – about $86,000.  As a man of honor, he declines the opportunity at first in order to remain true to his earlier and impulsive secret engagement to Lucy Steele.  But once he is released from that engagement by Lucy’s unexpected marriage to his brother Robert, instead of following through with Miss Morton, as his mother wishes, he comes to Barton Cottage to propose to Elinor, even though he realizes there is little hope of their being able to marry immediately.  Unlike Willoughby, Edward chooses love instead of money, even though his choice seems to mean a relatively small income.  The two Dashwood sisters have radically different conceptions of what constitutes a “competence,”  For the extravagant and romantic Marianne a competence is “ ‘eighteen hundred or two thousand a-year; not more than that’ ” (S&amp;S 91) – over $65,000.  But for the more modest Elinor, £1,000 is “ ‘my wealth’ ” (S&amp;S 91).  The contrast between “competence” and “wealth” is a revealing measure of the two sisters’ senses of proportion.  Yet Marianne sees her expectations as very moderate: “ ‘A family cannot well be maintained on a smaller.  I am sure I am not extravagant in my demands. A proper establishment of servants, a carriage, perhaps two, and hunters, cannot be supported on less’ ” (S&amp;S 91).  As things turn out, of course, Marianne achieves precisely what she hopes for in her marriage to Colonel Brandon, and Elinor is quite content with slightly less than her “wealth” in her marriage to Edward.

Some of the financial details in Sense and Sensibility can also help us to understand more clearly what would constitute an adequate income, or a “competence,” in Jane Austen’s day.  Each of the Dashwood daughters has inherited £1,000 from their great uncle.  Mrs. Dashwood has received £7,000 as her late husband’s only bequest to her.  Thus Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters have a combined wealth of £10,000 which will earn them £500 a year – $16,565.  On that income they are not only able to take care of their needs in housing, food, and clothing, but they are also in a position to afford to have three servants – two maids and a man – on their staff at Barton Cottage.  They are not wealthy, but they would appear to be at least comfortable financially.  Indeed, we are told that Mrs. Dashwood “was persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000 l. would support her in affluence” (S&amp;S 14).  This amount would earn her £350 a year – about $11,600.  And she believes she can save enough from £500 a year to make alterations in Barton Cottage, though she has never saved anything before in her life.  Colonel Brandon offers Edward the living at Delaford at £200 a year.  With the income from his own £2,000, Edward would have an income of £300 a year – almost $10,000.  Colonel Brandon thinks this would be enough for Edward to live on as a bachelor but not enough for him to marry.  But Mrs. Jennings – something of a romantic who can afford to be – believes £300 quite enough for a young couple to live on.
When Elinor and Edward become engaged, Edward’s £2,000 and Elinor’s £1,000 will earn them £150 from the five per cents.  This amount added to the Delaford living will give them £350 a year – about $ 11,600.  We are told that “they were neither of them quite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a-year would supply them with the comforts of life” (S&amp;S 369).  However, when Mrs. Ferrars relents and gives Edward £10,000 as she had done for Fanny, they have a total of £13,000 to invest in the five per cents and earn £650 a year in addition to the £200 from the Delaford living.  At £850 a year – a little more than $28,000 – Elinor has nearly achieved her “wealth.”
Money, at least as I have been discussing it, is not as much a central concern in Northanger Abbey, Mansfield Park, and Emma as it is in Pride and Prejudiceand Sense and Sensibility.  Catherine Morland will have £3,000 – over $99,000 – and perhaps even the Fullerton estate, but this matters very little to anyone except General Tilney, since Henry Tilney is secure of “a very considerable fortune” (NA 249) from marriage settlements and has an income “of independence and comfort” (NA 250).  Emma is the heiress to £30,000 – almost $1,000,000 and three times the fortune of Mrs. Elton.  Mr. Rushworth, with an income from Sotherton of £12,000 a year – over $397,000 – is the wealthiest of Jane Austen’s characters whose incomes we know but is otherwise virtually forgettable.  Edmund Bertram’s income from the Mansfield living, once he succeeds to it, is £700 a year – a little over $23,000 – somewhat less than the income of Edward and Elinor Ferrars.  But Edmund is, after all, the younger son of Sir Thomas Bertram, and there seems little question that both Sir Thomas and eventually Tom, when he inherits the baronetcy, will see that Edmund and Fanny are more than amply provided for.  In all of these novels, the central characters are generally already financially comfortable, and what references to money these novels do contain seem to be there only to establish that fact in order that Jane Austen can then move on to other matters.
Such is not the case, however, in Persuasion.  In fact. Sir Walter Elliot and his family would appear to be in rather desperate straits.  To be sure, he is the owner of the Kellynch estate, but because of his extravagance and debts he can no longer afford to live there and must lease Kellynch to Admiral Croft.  Presumably, the income from his rents and other farm income (if there is any) and the lease allow him to live in opulence and ostentation in the finest house in Camden Place in Bath.  But Kellynch will pass to Mr. William Walter Elliot on Sir Walter’s death.  The reality of Sir Walter’s circumstances is suggested in the passage describing the financial arrangements for Anne’s marriage to Captain Wentworth.  Sir Walter, we are told, “could give his daughter at present but a small part of the share of ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter” (P 248).  The passage is perhaps somewhat enigmatic, but it would appear that Sir Walter’s only fortune which will be available for inheritance by his daughters is £10,000 – a little over $330,000 – the same amount as the combined resources of Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters.  Assuming that this amount will be divided equally among his daughters on Sir Walter’s death, each daughter would inherit about £3,300 – a little over $109,000.  Mary has married well, but what is to become of Elizabeth?  She may, of course, also marry well – eventually – but given the nature of her personality and the minimal size of her apparent inheritance, her future would appear to be at least questionable and perhaps even extremely bleak.  Anne’s circumstances, of course, are quite a bit better.  At the time of her marriage, Wentworth has a fortune of £25,000 – £828,250.  Invested in the five per cents, that amount alone would bring them an income of £1250 a year – over $41,000.  But assuming that Anne will inherit an equal share of her father’s £10,000, she would eventually be able to add another £3,300 to their resources, which would give them a fortune of £28,300 – almost $938,000 – or in round figures almost $1,000,000.  In other words, the potential wealth available to Anne and Wentworth is almost equal to that of Emma Woodhouse.  At the time of their marriage, Anne is aware of “the disproportion in their fortune” (P 251), but that means nothing to her.  The only thing that disturbs her is “the consciousness of having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value” (P 251).
Financial matters in Jane Austen’s life have both their darker and their brighter side.  We know from her carefully kept records that Jane Austen earned a total of £684 13s. from the four of her novels that were published in her lifetime (Honan 393) – something over $22,500 – a fact that must give her readers today the shudders.  But the plight of Mrs. Austen and her daughters when they moved to the cottage in Chawton was not so bleak as it may appear.  Mrs. Austen was then receiving £210 a year from various sources, and this was supplemented by annual gifts from her sons James, Henry, Edward, and Frank which totalled £250.  Thus the annual income of the three Chawton ladies was £460 (Halperin 145) – slightly over $15,000 – fifteen times the per capita income – and the house was provided for them by Edward.  When Martha Lloyd joined them, she added her small income to their resources.  They were not wealthy by any means, but they were apparently comfortably middle-class – perhaps even upper middle-class.  They could even afford to keep at least one servant (Halperin 145) and could afford to buy a piano for the younger sister Jane for no more than thirty guineas (Letters 243).  Henry, with his usual optimism, wrote to Frank: “I really think that my Mother &amp; sisters will be to the full as rich as ever.  They will not only suffer no personal deprivation, but will be able to pay occasional visits of health and pleasure to their friends” (quoted in Honan 214).  Eventually, Jane Austen also invested £600 of the income from her writing in the navy five per cents which brought her personally an additional £30 a year – almost $1,000.  She was able to travel from time to time, to visit Henry in London, to attend the theatre fairly often, to shop for herself and her relatives – though always with a keen eye for prices.  Indeed, Mrs. Austen and her daughters seem to have been reasonably comfortable.  They could not be extravagant, and no doubt they could not do everything that they might wish to do, but there is nothing in the extant letters to suggest that they were in any way seriously impoverished or wanting.  To be sure, they were dependent on the brothers for more than half of their regular income, and would have preferred that income were larger, but there is no indication that they considered themselves in severe financial straits, even when circumstances made it necessary for Henry and Frank to discontinue their payments of £50 apiece to Mrs. Austen in 1816 (Austen-Leigh 222).  The Austen brothers did fairly well also.  Edward inherited Godmersham and Chawton.  Henry had his problems as a banker but eventually settled down to a comfortable life as a clergyman.  Both Frank and Charles were naval officers, and both eventually rose to the rank of admiral.  In 1807, Frank limited himself to a budget of £400 a year (Letters174) but could still afford to make his annual £50 contribution to the support of his mother and sisters.  Charles, since he was younger and a more junior officer than Frank, did not make any regular contribution to their income so far as we know.  In 1808 James’s income from the Steventon living was £1100, curate paid – about $36,000 – and he could afford to keep three horses (Letters 241)

Helpful as the equivalencies I have been using are, they do not necessarily tell us as much as we might wish to know about the actual cost of consumer goods in Jane Austen’s day and how far money went.  What did people in the early nineteenth century pay for things they purchased?  And how do those prices compare with what we might pay for similar or comparable items today?  Information on this subject is extremely difficult to come by, particularly in the resources I have had available to me.  And so I have resorted to what is at least as reliable as any other primary material for this kind of information – the letters of Jane Austen herself.  This is, after all, the very kind of material – letters, journals, diaries, ledgers, and the like – which historians use as a major source of their information, and her letters do tell us what she actually spent for consumer items.
It would be a tidy and a handy breakthrough if one could justifiably conclude that the 1988 U.S. dollar equivalent for the 1810 British pound could actually purchase two or even three times as much as an equivalent amount of money today.  We could then multiply $33.13 by two or three and have a clear sense of 1810 purchasing power in current U.S. dollars.  Indeed, that is what I had hoped to be able to do.  But the evidence simply doesn’t lend itself to such a clear pattern.  And there are problems with the evidence we do have.
In the first place, many of the references to money in Jane Austen’s letters are simply unclear, and thus it is impossible to determine what she means by them.  For example, she reports that she paid a half-guinea for four pair of worsted stockings, a shift, and a shawl, but there is no way to determine how much she paid for each.  In addition, it is difficult to know exactly what she means by some articles that she does give a price for.  She reports that she paid four shillings a yard for “gauzes,” but what are gauzes, and what are they used for?  We know that she bought “dimity,” apparently for Fanny who is referred to earlier in the letter, but there is no indication of what it is to be used for.  Other items she refers to simply don’t exist today.  I have looked in vain for a “pelisse,” and though I know roughly what it is, I can find no equivalent on a rack.  Jane Austen apparently had a special fondness for silk stockings, and she reports twice that she paid twelve shillings a pair for them; at $19.80 a pair they were very expensive in her day, but they are virtually non-existent, today. 
 
￼ 
       For those consumer items for which we do have a similar or comparable product available today, the pattern remains elusive even if we nudge the problem with some inferential guesses.  Some things are more expensive today, some things are less expensive, and some things are remarkably close to being the same (Table 3).  With some exceptions, fabric and clothing seems to have been more expensive in Jane Austen’s day than today.  While she paid 2s. 3d. – $3.72 – a yard for flannel, our cost today is more than double that amount.  Cotton fabric in her day apparently varied in price with the quality of the cloth and the print, but today printed cotton fabric is very inexpensive, by comparison, at only $3.69 a yard, though very fine printed cotton fabric (from Liberty’s of London) is much more expensive than anything she reports buying.  She records paying four shillings for a pair of gloves, which I assume are cloth because of the price – $6.60.  Though cloth gloves are virtually unavailable today, a pair of white nylon gloves sells for only $7.00.  In Emma Frank Churchill buys a pair of gloves, presumably leather, for a half-guinea or $17.39.  Today a pair of men’s leather gloves sells for a minimum of about $30.  She reports the cost of having a wool cloak made by an Alton seamstress as ten shillings or $16.50.  Today a seamstress would charge about $25 for the same job; the cost is higher, but not that much higher.  She paid 4s. 3d. a pair for cotton stockings – $7.02.  Today cotton stockings are rather rare, but Sears does sell them for $3.60 a pair.  If we assume that Jane Austen used cotton stockings for everyday wear, then we might compare her cost for cotton stockings with the average price of a pair of pantihose today, which I am told is about $4.50.  However, though some items of clothing are more expensive today than in Jane Austen’s time, fabric costs were generally higher then, and in addition, a woman of her day would also have to pay for the making of clothing by a seamstress.
Food, again with some exceptions, seems to have been less expensive in the early nineteenth century than it is today.  Meat, butter, and cheese were substantially cheaper, but for some reason fish was slightly more expensive.  And the price of bread then was almost the same as it is now.
Some of the miscellaneous prices Jane Austen mentions in her letters are interesting for a variety of reasons.  She reports in 1801 that Mr. Austen sold three cows from the farm at Steventon for 61 ½ guineas – $2,138.97 or $712.99 each.  Today a mature, milk-producing cow sells for about $700.  If we assume that the gold locket she bought for Cassandra was really gold and not simply gold-colored – and since it was for Cassandra, I assume that it was real gold – then (at 18s) she got a bargain by today’s standards, since a 14-karat gold locket sells today for $200 to $300.  If we assume that she did pay thirty guineas for a piano for Chawton – and we know that she did have a piano there – then she paid the equivalent of $1,043.34 for it.  Today a new Wurlitzer spinet sells for about $1600, but as recently as ten years ago a new spinet sold for about $1,000.  She paid six shillings – $9.90 – for a book of piano exercises for a beginner; today a similar book sells for about $6.00.  The retail price for the first edition of Pride and Prejudice was eighteen shillings – $29.70; today the typical price for a new hardback novel is about $20.  Edward paid sixty guineas for a pair of coach horses – $2,086.80; today a pair of horses suited for the same purpose would sell for $1,200 to $1,500.
There doesn’t seem to be a clear pattern in the evidence.  But fragmentary though it is, what the evidence does not suggest is that life was necessarily significantly less expensive in Jane Austen’s day than in our own.  People then no doubt had less money, and it probably went farther, not because things necessarily cost less but because they probably spent it on less and they spent it less frequently than we do today.  They were almost certainly not the intensive consumers that our society virtually forces us to be today.  Beyond that very general conclusion, for the moment we can only study the evidence and wonder.
Nobody wants to read Jane Austen with a calculator constantly at hand – least of all me.  But there are times when one can be useful.  Approximate though the current U.S. dollar equivalents for early nineteenth-century British currency may be, they do provide us with a sharper sense of a significant dimension of the reality which Jane Austen was responding to, the context in which that response arose, the reality which her works reflect, and the relationship of all of these to our own time.

            <Text>“Chapter 1 describes in tangible detail, with examples from life and literature, what it meant to live on twenty-five, forty, one hundred, or two hundred pounds on up to more than five thousand pounds a year in terms of where one resided, what one ate, what one might wear, how many servants one could afford, what entertainments and amenities one enjoyed, whether one kept a carriage, and the like.”
“Copeland regards fiction as more directly mimetic. Women’sgothic novels of the 1790swere concerned with “loss,dispossession, forced removal, isolation,” he writes, because the economic hardships of that decade weighed especially heavily on women. Each novel centers on “a bereft, penniless and wandering woman, victim of an unforgiving economy” (7) because single women trying to support themselves lived perilously close to that nightmare.”
“Copeland reports that heroines in the fiction ofthe1770s were cynosures in a world of courtly fashion and luxury, that in the 1780s they wore smart clothes and dashing hats,and that in the 1790s they suffered economic loss and despair and usually were penniless at some point in the story. In the first decade of the 1800s, he writes, the “heroine emerges in a sober costume of domestic duty” (132).Competent and rational, she saves the situation, whatever it is, by diligent application. Between 1810 and 1820 the heroine-axonsumer emerges, an elegant woman blessed with riches, taste,and also acharitable nature.”
“He seems unable to interpret some of what he reads as a critique of the evolving consumer economy from the standpoint of a society considerablycloser than our own to barter and economiesofsubsistence.”
“Copeland flattens all to goods that cost moneyand never invites politics to complicate his simple story of getting and spending.”

WITH JANE AUSTEN CHOSEN TO BE THE FACE of the next Bank of England ten-pound note, it is the perfect time to talk about Jane Austen and economics.  Money is a critical part of Jane Austen’s vivid portrayal of early nineteenth-century English life.  Many of her works revolve around her heroines’ quests for economic security.  However, modern readers do not have a good frame of reference for translating a nineteenth-century pound into a modern dollar.  We all remember that Mr. Darcy had an income of £10,000 a year, as Mrs. Bennet mentioned it often enough—but how much is £10,000 in dollars?  Where did this amount place him on the British social scale?1 

Depending on which method is used to calculate inflation, Mr. Darcy’s £10,000 in modern times varies dramatically: from approximately $990,000 to $16,000,000.  Although in modern times there is one standard accepted measure of inflation, the problem becomes more complex when attempting to capture inflation as far back in the past as the nineteenth century. 



If an economist wants to translate from 1995 dollars to 2015 dollars, the process is as simple as going to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and typing the dollar amount into their inflation calculator.  However, the inflation calculator only goes back as far as 1913, a full century after Jane Austen’s books. 

Why does the Bureau of Labor Statistics not provide a measure for inflation in earlier years?  To understand this, we must understand how inflation is calculated.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics first creates a consumer price index (CPI) based on the prices of a bundle of goods and services across eight categories:  food and beverages, housing, apparel, transportation, medical care, recreation, education and communication, and other goods and services.  The market basket is determined from detailed expenditure information from the Consumer Expenditure Surveys on typical day-to-day spending patterns in the U.S. Next, the Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates what this typical “basket” would cost by calling thousands of retail stores, service establishments, rental units, and doctors’ offices to obtain prices.  By comparing the cost of a “market basket” in one year to a “market basket” in another year, the consumer price index is created, measuring the percentage change in living expenses from one year to the next. 

Even the current consumer price index is a controversial measure of inflation.  Economists disagree on what should be included in the “bundle of goods” and whether consumers should be allowed to substitute different goods over time.  Also, inflation is not immediately reflected by changing prices, and therefore the CPI may lag behind true inflation.  Furthermore, the CPI only looks at urban spending patterns, not rural.  Finally, different people may experience inflation differently, which is the reason the Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates a separate CPI for the elderly. 

But if the consumer price index is controversial in modern times, it becomes impossible to use in the nineteenth century.  People lived very different lives two hundred years ago.  Instead of purchasing food at a local store, they often raised chickens or maintained gardens.  Instead of buying their clothes, they made them by hand.  For what they did buy, price data is often unavailable as detailed records of transactions were not well kept.  Most important, the large-scale shift in Britain from a rural, non-currency-based economy at the beginning of the nineteenth century to an increasingly urban, currency-based economy cannot easily be captured solely through changes in prices. 

How then can we measure the value of a pound in the early 1800s?  There are several possible methods, reflected in the table below.  All numbers are inflation-adjusted from 1810; roughly around the time of publication for many of Austen’s novels.  Data on prices, earnings, and GDP were obtained from the nonprofit group MeasuringWorth, which collects historical data on important economic aggregates.  Translation from pounds to dollars used the first quarter of 2015 exchange rate, the most recent available on Google Finance.  Finally, my methodology was to translate from 1810 pounds to modern pounds and then modern dollars.  If translations were made from 1810 pounds to 1810 dollars and then to modern dollars, the numbers would be different, but using British measures of inflation better reflects changes in the British economy.  All results are in current dollars, $2015. 

Others have attempted to calculate the wealth of Austen’s characters before, including a previous Persuasions article by James Heldman in 1989.  However, these calculations used the U.S. Consumer Price Index. Comparatively, the estimates in my paper use harder-to-find data on changes in British prices, earnings, and GDP, in order to better capture British inflation.  Many characters are excluded from the table because their income was never explicitly given in the books.  Of those available, the wealthiest character is Mr. Rushworth, whereas Mrs. Bates and her daughter are the poorest.  The variability in estimations demonstrates how difficult it is to capture inflation going back this far into the past. 

Depending on the method of calculation, Mr. Darcy’s £10,000 a year varies from $986,276 to $12,862,256 to $16,436,891.  Which of these three methods is the most accurate?  That depends on what we want to calculate. 

The first method uses the percentage increase in the U.K. retail price index to adjust to modern pounds.  This method is the closest to the modern technique of calculating inflation, the Consumer Price Index, in that it uses a representative sample of retail goods and services, but it is less comprehensive than the CPI.  The retail price index captures how purchasing power changed from 1810 to 2015, giving Mr. Darcy an annual income of $986,276 in terms of what he could buy in modern times.  This calculation would place him today in the 99.42 percentile.  This method may be the most reliable in capturing changes in prices, which is what we truly think of as inflation. 

The second method uses percent changes in U.K. average earnings, capturing how affordable items in 1810 would be relative to 2015.  This method gives Mr. Darcy an annual income of $12,862,256.  The salaries of servants and the other costs of maintaining an estate were smaller in the early nineteenth century; hence, using average earnings better shows how far Mr. Darcy’s money would have gone in 1810.  This method may be the most reliable in capturing the fortunes of the wealthier Austen characters, who would be able to take advantage of the economies of scale in owning an estate.  It is less reliable in capturing the economic conditions of those poorer.  For example, Mrs. and Miss Bates have only £100 a year and no estate, and they do not have the purchasing power advantages of the wealthy in their time period, thus making the first method the most reliable inflation calculation for them.

The third method uses percent changes in U.K. GDP per capita to capture Mr. Darcy’s status compared to what others earned in his time period.  This inflation measure attempts to capture the gap between the rich and the poor that existed in 1810 versus today.  It is a measure of prestige rather than purchasing power.  Using this method, Mr. Darcy’s annual earnings are $16,436,891, placing him in the 99.99 income percentile today. 

But income tells only part of the story.  Consider that most of Mr. Darcy’s fortune is in his home, property, and investments:  £10,000 is merely a year’s disposable income.  Further, that £10,000 is only a rumor, not a stated fact.  Inadequate information exists to capture the value of Mr. Darcy’s estate, Pemberley.  However, we can attempt to estimate his financial holdings.  When Jane Austen said that a character had a certain number of pounds per year, she implied that they invested their fortune and received that amount yearly in return.  Landed gentry in nineteenth-century Britain did not need to work because they could live off their investments.  A typical government fund paid 5% a year, or only 4% in the case of a small investment (Copeland, “Money” 134).2  Thus, Mr. Darcy’s £10,000 a year implies £200,000 invested.  As shown in the table below, this amount ranges in value depending on the method of calculation from $19,725,520 to $328,737,820.

The Modern Wealth of Jane Austen’s Characters 



*This estimate is based on standard rate of return on nineteenth-century investments that would generate £10,000 a year.  This number does not include the value of Mr. Darcy's estate and other property. 
Note:  The wealth of Jane Austen’s characters in this table is taken from Runcie and Campbell, who are indebted to Heldman, and who also examine the effects of inflation on Austen’s numbers.  Further estimates of the wealth of various Austen characters can be found in Francus. This table could be used to calculate any monetary number from Austen’s works as a fraction of the wealth above.  Many characters are excluded from the table because their precise income is never mentioned.

Although in terms of purchasing power he was a millionaire, in terms of the prestige Mr. Darcy held in British society he would have been a billionaire.  Historians estimate that the average holding of wealth of the top 1% of households in Jane Austen’s day was £100,000, and thus Mr. Darcy, with a fortune of £200,000,  was at the 99.75 percentile of British society; only perhaps  5,000 households were richer (DeLong 37).  Of these 5,000 households, only approximately 500 might hold noble titles.  In 1818, there were 28 dukedoms, 32 marquisates, 210 earldoms, 66 viscounts, and 172 barons in Great Britain (Millar).  Thus it was possible to be extremely wealthy and still not possess a noble title; in addition, the nobility were not necessarily the wealthiest people in Britain.  Based on Mr. Darcy’s annual income, other estimates have placed him in the top 400 families in England (Heldman 39), or the top 0.1%, what news articles refer to as the “super-rich.”  Mrs. Bennet’s near-hysteria upon news of her daughter’s marriage becomes understandable:  Elizabeth Darcy will  be a very wealthy woman. 

For Mr. Bennet, who had £2,000 a year, the retail price index method gives him an annual income of approximately $200,000, while GDP per capita gives him an annual income of approximately $3,000,000.  The former is a better method here, considering the size of Mr. Bennet’s fortune.  Given the Bennets’ money worries, even this lower estimate may seem high.  Colonel Brandon’s annual income in Sense and Sensibility is also £2,000, and he is considered a fine catch.  In Jane Austen’s time, about £1,000 a year was enough for a family to afford “three female servants, a coachman and footman, a chariot or coach, phaeton or other four-wheeled carriage, and a pair of horses” (Nottingham).  The cause of the Bennets’ financial difficulties is lack of a male heir.  They will lose their income when Mr. Bennet dies, and in addition, Mr. Bennet lacks savings:  “Mr. Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him” (308).  The Bennets are not poor:  poor money management has left the daughters without dowries. 



Jane Austen’s works also reflect attitudes towards money in early nineteenth-century British society.  When Jane Austen was born in 1775, the Industrial Revolution had just begun.  The English gentry still regarded capitalism, in particular the pursuit of wealth through trade rather than inheritance, with aristocratic snobbery.  However, money (or lack of it) is a central concern for Jane Austen’s heroines, who are dependent on marriage for financial security. 

Adam Smith, originator of the free market and known as the father of modern economics, wrote about the ethics of money in his book The Theory of Moral Sentiments, published in 1759 and extremely popular among Jane Austen’s contemporaries.  Smith wrote about how the pursuit of money could deform moral character and suggested that wealth and virtue might be mutually exclusive.  Smith was torn between his belief that money promoted human progress and his personal conviction that it did not make people happy.  This ambivalent attitude towards money was common in Austen’s society.  Elsie B. Michie contends that Austen often associates the rich with the same negative attitudes that are criticized in Adam Smith’s The Theory of Moral Sentiments:  the equating of wealth  and virtue, scorn for poorer people, and selfishness (26). 

However, Austen characters who claim to have no interest in money are usually lying:  Isabella Thorpe in Northanger Abbey tells Catherine Morland about her disdain for money prior to discarding James Morland for the wealthier Frederick Tilney.  In Sense and Sensibility, when Marianne and Elinor discuss money, Marianne claims love is more important, but it soon becomes evident that her minimum standard for living is much higher than her more practical sister’s.  Even though Austen herself was portrayed by her family members as a humble soul who wrote only for the joy of writing and was shocked to receive any money for her novels, she complained in a letter to a friend about receiving only £110 for the copyright of Pride and Prejudice (29-30 November 1812).  In another letter, referring to her desire for greater financial success for her books, she wrote, “tho’ I like praise as well as anybody, I like what Edward calls Pewter too” (30 November 1814).  In her fiction Austen exhibits a keen awareness of money and its power over women’s lives, even as she seeks not to give it a power that overrules love or virtue. 

Although Jane Austen writes about the landed gentry, she was not one of them.  The Austens fell into a group Edward Copeland describes as the “pseudo-gentry”:  socially holding kinship to the landed gentry while dependent on earned income from a male breadwinner (“Money” 128).3  This group was also less insulated from economic turmoil.  During Jane Austen’s own lifetime, the British economy experienced a series of economic crises.  An oversized national debt, four waves of recession, two banking crises, the debasement of coins, a major economic crash, and a depression led, in combination, to a doubling of consumer prices, i.e., extreme inflation. 

In 1795, as Sheryl Craig has shown, the first financial crisis of Jane Austen’s lifetime occurred in the form of a massive crop failure brought on by a long drought and a harsh winter (“Wealth” 13).  The price of bread, meat, milk, and cheese doubled, leading to food riots across England.  Contemporary economists estimated that the poor in England reached eight million out of a total population of nine million, almost 90 percent of the population (Himmelfarb 77).  It is difficult to imagine such large scale poverty today; for comparison’s sake, during the Great Depression, poverty in the United States reached approximately 50 percent (Katz and Stern 13).  In addition, politics stalled any government aid.  The Whigs and some Tories opposed Prime Minister Pitt’s Poor Law reform bill, claiming it “rewarded the idle and negligent” (qtd. in Himmelfarb 75), while privately believing they could just wait for Adam Smith’s invisible hand of the marketplace to right the economy (Craig, “Pride” 66).  In Sense and Sensibility, John Dashwood’s self-justified lack of interest in helping his family resembles the inertia of Parliament (Craig, “Wealth” 21).  Additionally, at least some of the Dashwoods’ fiscal problems are likely driven by the extreme loss of purchasing power  due to inflation, a situation that Jane Austen did not need to explain to her contemporary readers. 

Jane Austen began writing First Impressions, the first draft of Pride and Prejudice, in the autumn of 1796.  By this point, as Craig has indicated, Prime Minister Pitt had realized the futility of his Poor Law reform and attempted to focus on the national minimum wage.  Reflecting prevalent views of economists at the time that the poor were responsible for their own poverty, opposing politicians claimed that “laborers and their families could be maintained on their low wages, if they gave up eating wheat bread and adopted a more Spartan diet” (Craig, “Pride” 68).  This solution was unrealistic given contemporary food scarcity, but still Parliament failed to pass the minimum wage or any other form of economic relief.  Pride and Prejudice subtly reflects these politics.  Craig points out that Mr. Darcy is praised for his generosity to the poor in his home county Derbyshire, whereas Lady Catherine visits the poor solely to offer unsolicited advice and criticize them for being inadequately frugal, leaving them no better off for her visits (69).  To a modern reader, it might seem to go without saying that generosity to the poor is a noble quality, but in the environment of nineteenth century England, not everyone would agree, and thus Jane Austen was making a political statement when she upheld Mr. Darcy as a positive example. 

As is well known, Jane Austen was ill-paid for her books, receiving only £684 from publishing four books in her lifetime (Honan 393).  Under the retail price index measure of inflation, this amount translates to lifetime earnings of $67,456.  The retail price index is the best measure to use here, since the Austens were not wealthy enough to take advantage of the economies of scale captured in other measures of inflation.  After Jane Austen’s death, through 1832, her six novels earned a total of about £1,625 or $160,258.  The price of £110 paid by Egerton for Pride and Prejudice translates into $10,848; after the book’s success, Austen was to regret selling the copyright for that amount.  Jan Fergus calculates that Egerton subsequently made more than £450, or $44,379, from the book (9).  Given the millions of dollars in sales of TV shows, movies, and books based on Pride and Prejudice since then, from a modern perspective, perhaps Jane Austen was cheated.  However, the continued popularity of Jane Austen spin-offs stands as a tribute to her genius.

            <Text>“Copeland’s argument is that income per se is never the whole story. As Adam Smith understood, ‘necessaries’ had symbolic as well as economic meaning: they were the goods required to maintain claims to social rank — two or more servants, fashionable dress and furniture, a carriage, a set of china, a pianoforte, and so on. In Sense and Sensibility, as Mrs. Jennings is well aware, Lucy Steele could easily make do on the income that Edward and Elinor consider insufficient”

“In the novels of Austen, as in the novels of Burney and the ‘genteel Gothic’ of Charlotte Smith, the central question is not primarily whether the genteel heroine will survive but how she can maintain her status in a mobile and aggressively competitive economy.”

“Caught between a traditional and rural economy and one of competitive consumption, Austen sought in all of her novels to define a moral economics by distinguishing between acceptable and unacceptable consumption, good and bad gift-giving. … Following David Spring, Copeland sees Austen as a member of the ‘pseudo-gentry,’ anxious to retain her connections to the landed order; and following Pierre Bourdieu, he reads manners in relation to consumption as a way of retaining and legitimating power.”</Text>

Darcy’s Wealth:  An Addendum
 
MARY MOGFORD

To gain some sense of what Darcy’s wealth might mean in modern terms, the difficulties inherent in comparisons of actual wealth or of purchasing power in 1810 and 1990 can be overcome to some degree by instead calculating the income of someone with 300 times today’s per capita income.  If one takes the average per capita income in 1989 for both the US ($20,894) and Canada (US$20,105) using standard market rates, one can see that an income 300 times larger would be $6,268,200 (US) or US $6,031,500 (Canada).
Again, a straight comparison of actual wealth is misleading given the relative distribution of wealth in society in Jane Austen’s day as compared to our own.  The fact that there was less money around in 1810 than today, both in total and in proportion to the population, together with the relative poverty of most of the population, meant that Darcy stood out even among those with significant incomes.  Today, an income of $300,000 (using Professor Heldman’s figures) would mean that Darcy would lead an extremely comfortable life, but would not place him at the average of “the top 400 families.”  But, with an income of over $6 million, or 300 times today’s per capita income, he would certainly be regarded as outstandingly wealthy – more in keeping with his status in the world of Pride and Prejudice!

Location, Location, Location: The Spaces of Pride &amp; Prejudice

MARY M. CHAN
 
Mary M. Chan (email: mary.chan@ualberta.ca) is a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Alberta.  She has previously published in Persuasions and Persuasions On-Line, and has presented at two JASNA AGMs.  She is currently working on her dissertation, which analyzes domestic spaces in the eighteenth-century novel.

 
Jane Austen’s novels are limited in scope, a fact she acknowledges in her famous, facetious comment comparing her writing to the painting of a miniature portrait, “the little bit (two Inches wide) of Ivory on which I work with so fine a Brush, as produces little effect after much labour” (16 December 1816).  Though Austen was being playfully ironic in her letter to her nephew, her novels are indeed limited in one key aspect:  they predominantly take place indoors, in drawing rooms and in ballrooms.  Spaces, particularly interior spaces, embody the societal scrutiny under which Austen’s characters operate and indicate the limitations of her heroines’ worlds.  Yet the 2005 film adaptation of Pride and Prejudice (dir. Joe Wright) alters the novel’s use of space, relocating key scenes outdoors and transposing other scenes indoors.  This article addresses the effect of moving from interior to exterior space (or vice versa), as well as the general organization and representation of cinematic space in the film.  In Pride &amp; Prejudice, space is used to characterize individuals and households, and, ultimately, social spaces (and spaces of sociability) are left behind for the space of romance.
 
Space is more than art direction or set design, or even the country houses and landscaped gardens used as backgrounds for filming.  Rather, space itself produces meaning.  Henri Lefebvre notes that space is active, that it can act upon unaware subjects.  In his book The Production of Space, Lefebvre argues that space is ideological, and that ideology in fact emerges from space:  “What is an ideology without a space to which it refers, a space which it describes, whose vocabulary and links it makes use of, and whose code it embodies?” (44).  Cinematic space is particularly telling because its onscreen presence can rival that of actors:  “space can be seen to contribute to the dynamics of the narrative and can be shown to play an important part in the development of a variety of considerations, both ideological and artistic” (Konstantarakos 1).  Depending on how a shot is composed, a space can even dominate the frame.  And though both films and novels are heavily mediated forms, their visibility on screen grants filmic spaces an immediacy that descriptive spaces in novels lack.
 
Critical attention to space in film adaptations of Jane Austen’s novels has largely focused upon exterior spaces, particularly the use of landscape.  Kathi L. Groenendyk, for example, analyzes the importance of the picturesque in her consideration of landscape in Persuasion (1995) and Sue Parrill examines how landscape can be employed thematically and for characterization in Pride and Prejudice (1995) and Sense and Sensibility (1995).  H. Elisabeth Ellington argues that the lovingly shot, bucolic landscapes of the 1995 mini-series of Pride and Prejudice are commodities consumed by both Elizabeth Bennet, gazing out the window at Pemberley’s grounds, and by the viewer.
 
Certainly, spaces in films convey information about character.  Ellington notes that “[o]ur understanding of the nuances of the story depends on our ability to read Darcy’s and Elizabeth’s different reactions to landscape” (94).  In the film Pride &amp; Prejudice, landscape is used primarily to characterize Lizzie Bennet as a free spirit who cannot be constrained by the rigid expectations of her society.1  After she refuses Mr. Collins’s proposal, Lizzie runs out of the house to a nearby lake, as if escaping the pressures to marry well for the sake of the family.  The character’s association with the outdoors is best exemplified (and amplified) by the long, sweeping helicopter shot of Lizzie Bennet (played by Keira Knightley) standing on the precipice of a large cliff, the wind blowing her hair and the sun shining down, a shot so iconic that it is used as the background for the DVD’s main menu.  The helicopter shot of the precipice is one of several shots of Lizzie in a beautiful landscape, including her trek to Netherfield to visit Jane, which is an extreme long shot of a giant tree on the left and Knightley’s silhouette walking across the field towards the right side of the frame.  As a result of the long shots, Knightley’s slight figure is overwhelmed by the visual splendor of the shot and the swelling music of the score.  Lizzie Bennet is in essence reduced to being a part of the landscape rather than just being in the landscape; the film paradoxically celebrates Lizzie’s independence while minimizing the percentage of the screen that she appears in.
 
For all the critical attention paid to landscape, interiors are equally significant to eighteenth-century conceptions of characterization.  Austen’s famous description of Pemberley makes readers reconsider Darcy because we assume that a man with such a well-appointed house cannot be entirely disagreeable:  Elizabeth “had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste” (245).  Two eighteenth-century aesthetic concepts underlie Elizabeth’s praise of the interplay between nature and artifice.  First is Pemberley’s adherence to the picturesque, a late-eighteenth-century aesthetic movement that favored a balance between natural beauty and artificial landscaping.  Second is the concept of “convenience,” the idea that the house should reflect the character of its owner.  A term mainly employed in eighteenth-century architectural writings to describe the appearance of houses, convenience was the concept that an exterior “should express the purpose of a building and the social status of its inhabitant” (Varey 156).  Pemberley’s tasteful exterior indicates to Elizabeth (and the reader) that its owner is equally measured, elegant, and handsome.
 
Convenience (of the architectural kind) is also evident in Wright’s Pride &amp; Prejudice, as the sets and décor of Longbourn and Netherfield correspond to the characters of the people living inside them.  Though Longbourn seems a little too dilapidated to be a gentleman’s home, the marked contrast between the properties is a readily-grasped indicator of the disparity between the neighbors’ economic and social situations.  Netherfield is an excellent extension of the Bingleys’ fortune:  brightly lit to the point of sterility, large rooms sparsely furnished, and populated by a small army of servants.  The perpetual neatness of the interior suggests an adherence to societal rules and propriety.  Ironically, the décor and furnishings (new, immaculate) suggest characteristics of the Bingleys evident in the novel but not the film, namely their new-moneyed status and Miss Bingley’s aims for social advancement.  In contrast, Longbourn suggests that the Bennets are one generation away from being downwardly mobile.  The house is messy, cluttered, and in need of a new coat of paint.  The color palette is noticeably earthier and darker than Netherfield’s pastels, and we see only three servants (Mr. and Mrs. Hill, plus the young maid).  The state of Longbourn matches the state of the Bennet family:  constantly disheveled, genteel but shabby, and in need of money.  As a property, Longbourn is also strongly associated with agrarian labor.  In addition to the pig that walks through a back corridor, we also see workers in the yard.  The presence of the estate’s workers further emphasizes Longbourn’s seemingly lower social status.
 
The difference between the two households is also conveyed by the way that each space is shot.  Longbourn is a more intimate, spontaneous space.  Wright favors unsteady, hand-held cameras to shoot many scenes in Longbourn, including an early shot of Lizzie staring through the library window at her parents.  The shaky shots are reminiscent of documentary and cinema verité styles of filmmaking.  There are often quick pans and zooms at Longbourn as the camera seems to search for the most interesting moment.  For instance, after Lizzie rejects Mr. Collins’s proposal, the door behind a kneeling Mr. Collins bursts open, and the other Bennet women spill into the room, laughing.  The camera quickly pans up from a kneeling Mr. Collins to the sisters behind him and then pans slightly to the right and zooms in on Mary Bennet, staring at Collins with a look that clearly conveys her wounded love for him.  The camera movement in Longbourn is active, itself reflecting the lively character of the Bennet family.
 
The fluidity of the camera movement at Longbourn is replaced with more staid, though still mobile, camera work at Netherfield.  In that setting, Wright favors medium shots of actors sitting still, forming compositions reminiscent of tableaus (e.g., the Bennet women sinking into a sofa, Lizzie reading while sitting in the middle of a sofa, Bingley reclining at the end of the sofa across from her).  Setting aside for the moment the sequences at the ball, Netherfield is generally filmed more statically than Longbourn is, suggesting the more formal character of its inhabitants and that the rooms are more interesting than the people in them.
 
For all its attention to art direction and the details of set design, though, Pride &amp; Prejudice is a movie concerned more with how people fill a space, with how it feels to be within a space, experiencing it in three dimensions.  The “you are there” approach is evident in the film’s large number of tracking shots, particularly shots where the camera moves through doorways.  The viewer is introduced to the Bennet household via a long tracking shot in which a camera moves through the back door, down a corridor, into the dining room, and through one of two front doors to rejoin Lizzie on the front porch.  In the case of Longbourn, the filmmakers of Pride &amp; Prejudice benefit from filming in a house rather than on a soundstage that lacks a fourth wall.  Not only does the camera show the space, but it shows how it feels to move through the space.  Movement through doors is also evident at Netherfield, where the camera tracks into the drawing room, showing us the set of double doors on either side.  Later, as servants prepare to close up Netherfield, the camera tracks backwards out of a room through a set of double doors, which then magically close themselves.
 
Tracking through doors and down corridors creates a space that is tangible and in some cases even claustrophobic.  Longbourn in particular is a social space filled with noise, laughter and people.  There is no peace or quiet in a house of five daughters, save perhaps in Mr. Bennet’s famous library.  The claustrophobic nature of Longbourn is reinforced by the unsteady camerawork, including a shot from the point of view of the Bennet sisters as they eavesdrop on their parents through a crack in the door.  Due to its limited square footage, the interior space of Longbourn offers little privacy; doors are not soundproof and beds are shared.  Longbourn’s sociability is also conveyed by the often overlapping and sometimes indecipherable dialogue of the Bennet sisters, such as Kitty and Lydia negotiating to borrow Jane’s dress for the assembly ball.  In the case of Longbourn, sociability means people, noise and no privacy, ironic for what would usually be considered the most private of spaces, the home.
 
Like domestic  interiors, public interiors in Pride &amp; Prejudice offer little privacy but much sociability.  The film’s two ball sequences represent another sense of the social world, the public aspect.  Domestic and public sociability hardly differ.  There is as much gossip at the assembly and Netherfield balls as there is at Longbourn, as much criticism of neighbors and playing out of courtship rituals (e.g., Mr. Collins).  The lack of privacy is even more acute:  though one could conceivably hold a private conversation masked by the general noise of the room, the larger number of people also increases the chances of being overheard, much as Lizzie overhears Mr. Darcy insult her at the assembly ball or Mr. Darcy overhears Mrs. Bennet touting Jane and Bingley’s advantageous match at Netherfield.  Moreover, one’s actions are always subject to everyone else’s observation.  At the assembly ball, Lizzie notices Jane and Bingley looking at each other.  What both balls convey—which the Longbourn scenes do not—is the physicality and immediacy of being in a large room with many people.  The dancers are sweaty, people fan themselves and chase after refreshments, hair becomes messy and clothing askew.
 
The sheer dizzying effect of the Netherfield ball is best demonstrated by a tour-de-force, three-minute-long take in which the camera tracks from room to room, through hallways and a foyer as different characters move in and out of the frame, finally ending on an overwhelmed Lizzie catching her breath in a quiet, moonlit hallway.  Long takes cede a certain amount of control to the viewer, who must decide what he or she wants to focus on:  “the eye is free—or rather compelled—to roam where it pleases, like one of the bedazzled guests” (Winter 83).  The roaming eye, analogous to the roaming camera, finds it impossible to light on only one character, one conversation, one room.  Watching the movement through the social space becomes analogous to moving through the space itself.
 
If interior spaces in Pride &amp; Prejudice are associated with sociability, what of the exterior spaces?  As I have discussed, outdoor spaces in the movie are used to emphasize Lizzie Bennet’s free spirit and independent thinking.  The shift in meaning from indoors to outdoors is evident when key scenes are relocated from interior to exterior spaces, or vice versa.  Among these scenes is the aftermath of Lizzie’s rejection of Collins’s proposal. In the novel, Mr. Bennet’s famous “‘unhappy alternative’” speech (“‘From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents.—Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do’” [112]) occurs in his library.  Throughout the novel, Mr. Bennet’s library is his sanctuary, the quiet space from which he holds court (e.g., it is where Bingley and Darcy meet with him to request his daughters’ hands in marriage).  The library, however, is also his hiding place, a physical manifestation of his neglectful parenting.  In the adaptation, Lizzie Bennet runs out of doors immediately after the rejection, with Mrs. Bennet comically chasing after her.  Mr. Bennet’s speech occurs beside a lake on the Longbourn property.  The conversation pressuring Lizzie to accept no longer takes place in her father’s realm but in hers; it is less about his failures as a parent and more about her status as an independent young woman.  Setting the scene in a space associated with Lizzie’s independence means that there is never any real doubt about the outcome of the conversation.  However, the impact of Lizzie’s defiance is lessened by being outside, as the exterior location itself lends her a modicum of power in the film’s spatial code.  Lizzie seems less rebellious by being more at home outdoors.
 
If Lizzie draws power from exterior spaces, moving her confrontation with Lady Catherine indoors seems illogical.  Lady Catherine’s arrival in the middle of the night means that the confrontation cannot possibly take place in the “‘prettyish kind of a little wilderness’” where it occurs in the novel (352).  Sue Parrill, referring to the 1995 miniseries and the novel, notes Elizabeth’s advantage in such a location:  “Perhaps Lady Catherine should have chosen a more formal location for her demands, since Elizabeth’s defiance finds an appropriate setting in this natural environment” (42).  Yet counter-intuitively setting the confrontation indoors renders Elizabeth’s logical dismantling of Lady Catherine’s argument more striking.  By this point in the story, Elizabeth’s self-knowledge has developed; she knows that she is in love with Darcy.  Her self-knowledge translates to strength of character, and the fact that she successfully confronts Lady Catherine in an unnatural, interior space not usually associated with her independence speaks to her growth and her strength.
 
The most significant relocation of a scene from interior to exterior space is Darcy’s proposal to Elizabeth.  While the filmmakers retain Darcy’s first awkward visit to Hunsford where he attempts to propose before being interrupted, the second attempt takes place at what appears to be an eighteenth-century neoclassical temple, though finer details are difficult to discern in the pouring rain.2  The location of the temple and its place in the film’s world is unknown.  Is it a part of Lady Catherine’s estate at Rosings?  If not, how far is it from Rosings and Hunsford Parsonage?  That we cannot literally place the scene anywhere within the world of the film indicates how out of place it is.  The scene is literally and figuratively set apart from the rest of the movie.
 
What are the effects of the relocation?  While the proposal scene retains most of the novel’s dialogue, its tone is a departure from the formal conversations of the interior spaces of Netherfield and even Longbourn.  The outdoor setting, the dramatic music, the pouring rain and the near kiss are more keeping with a small-r romanticism that becomes increasingly evident in the film, a shift which has been noted by numerous reviewers (Lane, Lacey, McBride).  The proposal exemplifies the change in the film’s tone and use of space that occurs once Lizzie arrives at Hunsford.  Spaces are shot less fluidly as the conventions of the romance plot take over:  “As it builds in melodramatic momentum, however, the film relies more and more on close-ups and the conventional rhythms of shot and reverse-shot” (Winter 83).  Gone are the long takes and tracking shots of the sociable spaces; the social world has been left behind for the space of the romance plot and conventional film grammar.
 
Much is lost with the removal from the social world.  The proposal scene itself is intensely performed, and handheld cameras are still used to convey intimacy and urgency.  Yet setting such an emotionally intense scene, and one of the main turning points of the novel, outdoors is parallel to relocating the “‘unhappy alternative’” scene:  the setting leaves no doubt about the emotional nature of the conversation.  Austen’s interiors stand for more than just the social world; they also stand for social constraints.  Austen heroes and heroines struggle to convey their deepest feelings through the minutest of gestures.  Any confession of feelings renders a person vulnerable.  The lack of privacy in interior spaces is the reason Darcy leaves abruptly after his first abortive attempt at Hunsford, demonstrating that exterior spaces are ironically more private than interiors.  However, interior spaces reify the social constraints that all Austen characters operate under.  Even in the film adaptation, Lizzie rejects Darcy’s proposal for social reasons:  he separated Bingley and Jane, “exposing [his] friend to the censure of the world for caprice and [her] sister to its derision for disappointed hopes,” refused to help Mr. Wickham advance in the world, and behaved in an un-gentlemanlike manner.  Standing as a reminder of the social world during the proposal scene in the novel, Hunsford is a multivalent space, a nexus of motives for marriage.  Hunsford parsonage is a site of dependence, as Lady Catherine can dispose of it at her will.  It is a site of Charlotte’s independence from spinsterhood achieved though her own “advantageous” marriage, her opportunity to have her own much-desired establishment (122).  It is also a place where Mr. Collins can subtly show his cousin what she has lost by rejecting his proposal.  In fact, it is heavily ironic that Elizabeth is proposed to in the home of a man whose proposal she rejected.  Overall, Hunsford represents an opportunity that Elizabeth deems insufficient, a quality that can also be applied to Darcy’s proposal.
 
Setting the proposal outside in a neoclassical temple removes all the earthbound concerns associated with Hunsford, the rich ironies and the social satire.  Entering a romantic space entails leaving behind social space. In the movie, romantic space is about the individuals—individual lovers, specifically—who rise above the world.  The otherworldly aspect of Lizzie and Darcy’s love affair is reaffirmed by their reconciliation by sunrise.  As she walks through a field, Lizzie spies Darcy striding towards her, emerging from the mist.  As they reconcile and almost kiss, the shot is framed so that the sun appears behind them, shining through as if ordained by the heavens (or the director?) to do so.  The final scene of the North American release, in which Darcy and Lizzie kiss repeatedly at Pemberley, is another instance of the fairy-tale nature of the film’s latter half.  From the establishing shot of Pemberley with four swans in the reflecting pool to the ridiculous sight of Darcy and Lizzie in their bedclothes on the balcony (one wonders if all the servants had the night off?), the final scene is a significant departure from the grounded representations of the social world that comprised the film’s earlier moments.  It is pure romance as the camera tracks forward not through a space, but towards the lovers, culminating in that most romantic of gestures—a kiss.
 
Spaces in films and novels are often imbued with meaning, suggesting readings that correspond to or deviate from the narrative.  The 2005 film adaptation of Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice takes pleasure in representing interior spaces, specifically by using long tracking shots to create the illusion of moving through a three dimensional space.  The interior spaces pulse with energy but yield to a more conventional romance narrative and therefore more conventionally shot spaces, particularly exteriors.  By the movie’s end, melodramatic representations of romantic space are a far remove from the keenly observed social world that characterizes Jane Austen’s work.  By turning its focus to romance and the creation of romantic spaces, Pride &amp; Prejudice (2005) embraces grand exteriors at the expense of social interiors, ignoring the old maxim that it’s what’s inside that counts.
 
 
NOTES
 
1.  To be consistent with the practice of Pride &amp; Prejudice (2005) and its reviewers, I refer to the character played by Keira Knightley as “Lizzie.”  “Elizabeth” denotes the character in Austen’s novel and in other adaptations.  While Austen spells Elizabeth's nickname "Lizzy," I defer to the DVD's subtitles and the film's reviewers in the spelling "Lizzie." 
 
2.  In the director’s commentary on the DVD, Joe Wright indicates that the proposal was filmed at the Stourhead estate, and that it was the only scene filmed at that location.  The specific building is the Apollo’s Temple at Stourhead.  The location is at least appropriate for the novel’s time period; Stourhead’s gardens were opened to the public in the 1740s (Troost 481).

My fields study has confirmed my interest in Hannah More, Charlotte Smith, and Mary Robinson as writers creatively making use of multiple genres in the public mediascape. However, it has also highlighted Ann Radcliffe\'92s striking difference in these terms. Her difference in approach and marketing, despite her wide-reaching fame, could be the object of my study of her works. I could turn instead to Sarah Scudgell Wilkinson, a prolific writer of Gothic chapbooks as well as longer works of multiple kinds, as my entry to the \'91School of Radcliffe.\'92 Or, my reading has interested me in Samuel Taylor Coleridge\'92s writing for periodicals; he could take Radcliffe\'92s place as a \'91key writer\'92 for a shift away from the Gothic.\
I am unsure about how best to structure my use of \'91key authors\'92 to shape my study: it seems crucial to [ground my broader observations in detailed examination of individual attempts to navigate the complex systems], and to apply my contextual findings to individual case studies. However, I am not sure how many authors is appropriate, or how to select them \'97 especially since one of my key questions is, \'93how can we appropriately select \'91representatives\'92 from complex bodies of texts?\'94 }

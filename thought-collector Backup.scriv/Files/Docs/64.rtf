\cf2 This collection of essays recaptures the development in Moretti\'92s career of his theories of literary history as evolutionary and as an imbalanced center-periphery system of exchange, alongside his increasing use of computational methods that come to be known as \'91distant reading.\'92 Moretti\'92s interest in accounting for the \'93great unread\'94 of literature, and his use of computational models to carry out comparative research, provides much of the theoretical background for my own methods. }

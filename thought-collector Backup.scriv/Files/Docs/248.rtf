\'93She\'85 now had at handa book of 3 years before, still with many empty pages; thus, on 14 Feb, when she needed another book for the Grasmere Journal, she filled this, leaving 1 blank page, and writing on until 2 May 1801 when she met the fragment of W\'92s essay on moralists coming from the other end.\'94\

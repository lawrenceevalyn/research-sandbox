You could include author bios at at author's first appearance, but the whole system of biographical readings would break down.. instead, there would have to be running historical contextualization. It would make current ways of teaching inconvenient, but perhaps in productive ways: if you wanted to read a bunch of poems by one author, students would have to skip past the other writing that was produced in between, a tangible reminder of the time that actually did separate those works. It also makes it easier to sub in less "important" authors, when you're looking for a work to fill just one chronological slice rather, than an author whose ouevre will be broadly applicable.}

To edit chronologically requires deciding, often at an astonishing level of particularity, exactly when a work first came into being. Almost no work is straightforwardly reducible to a single date, especially if one seeks to capture composition rather than publication: [Smith\'92s sonnets, Lyrical Ballads, Coleridge \'97 but even Walpole and Lewis whose second editions make a different stir than their first].}

My interest in timeliness is not unprecedented. William St. Clair\'92s exhaustive bibliographical study of book prices and David Brewer\'92s reflection on the recent quantitative turn in literary studies both call attention to the limits of what St. Clair calls the \'93parade of authors\'94 and \'93parliament of texts\'94 models of literary history, and the need to account for what Brewer terms the \'93footprint\'94 left by the ongoing impact of texts beyond their moment of initial publication. Both of these studies, and others like them, enrich our understanding of the immediate timely context of literary productions, particularly as expressed in the marketing and sale of texts to readers. Among Felski\'92s alternatives to critique, too, is Wai Chee Dimock\'92s concept of \'93resonance,\'94 which takes Brewer\'92s \'93footprint\'94 as the primary object of study to trace the \'93busy afterlife of the literary artifact\'94 which \'93refutes our efforts to box it into a moment of origin.\'94 This \'93busy afterlife\'94 can be seen beyond the immediate material book history of the work\'92s editions, in the interplay between reading practices, audiences, and literary genres. }

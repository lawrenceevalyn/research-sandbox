\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Al\cb1 though I have described these three ways of modeling the decade 1789-99 in sequence, I will rese\cb3 arch them in parallel, with an eye to the connections between them. I will look at how each of the three models represents the position of my case study authors among their peers. To interpret those findings, I will consider the construction of each model, to determine what each occludes and what it renders visible. My many disparate approaches will converge on my central question: what texts can be said to be \'93representative\'94 of this decade? And what do they \'93represent\'94?}

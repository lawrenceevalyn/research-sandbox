Connecting discussion and conclusions: • Your conclusions are what your discussion chapter has been arguing for. • You could write the conclusions to your whole study as the last section of a chapter called ‘Discussion and Conclusions’, but it is usually preferable to have a separate ‘Conclusions’ chapter. • If they form a separate chapter there should be no conclusions to the discussion chapter, and you should inform the reader of this in the discussion. Rules about conclusions: • You should draw your conclusions solely from the discussion chapter. • There should be little further discussion in the conclusions chapter. • The conclusions should respond to the aim stated in the first chapter. • Summaries are not conclusions. • Conclusions should be crisp and concise. • The conclusions can be used to briefly explore the implications of your findings.

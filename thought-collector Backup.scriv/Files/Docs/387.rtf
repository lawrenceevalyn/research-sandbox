\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Gamer\'92s work provides a foundation for the non-digital elements of my inquiry, detailing the interconnectednesss of what is now seen as the separate categories of \'91high\'92 Romantic literature and \'91low,\'92 popular Gothic writing. Gamer explores the paradox that \'93gothic readers, gothic writers, and gothic reviewers are specific categories that do not reflect the demographic makeup of late-eighteenth-century British readership yet dominate gothic\'92s reception\'94 (37), to argue that \'93gothic\'92s cultural stigma could serve as a basis for the construction of more legitimate cultural forms\'94 (200). By using Gothic materials in self-avowedly non-Gothic ways, Romantic writers could appeal to popular taste while maintaining social cachet.}

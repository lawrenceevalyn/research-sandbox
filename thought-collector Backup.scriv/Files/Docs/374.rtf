A central tension for me is the sense that Hannah More and William Wordsworth are both falling into similar traps of aestheticizing and moralizing their disdain for the very real distress for those in poverty, and that I nonetheless find Shepherd of Salisbury Plain more palatable than Michael. Michael in its beauties disguises its operations; More is so transparent that it\'92s easy to simply set aside what is unpalatable and read for the other details.\

Willard McCarty stands out for often producing short articles which simply accumulate vocabulary from other fields and present them for consideration. My past work has made extensive use of his definitions of models and prototypes; now, his chapter on interdisciplinary research strikes me as particularly fruitful. Willard McCarty says that \'93[t]he range of possibilities in interdisciplinary research is from theft to assimilation\'94: the current state of \'93digital humanities\'94 research still involves a lot of theft. Digital humanists kidnap computational methods for their own, often-unrelated needs, but more dangerously, digital research often steals an aura of empirical objectivity from its proximity to \'93hard sciences.\'94 The aura of objective truth carried by graphs and tables \'97 an aura which is actively cultivated by many digital humanities practitioners, especially Franco Moretti \'97 is an illusion that does not reflect how the sciences understand their own work. Because, as McCarty observes, \'93research in a discipline to which one is alien is difficult to see as good research, or even to see as research at all,\'94 it is easy for computational humanities research to dazzle or to fizzle, but hard for it to usefully inform. Transitioning from theft to something closer to assimilation will require a calm recognition that many scientific papers present incorrect results, and that the rhetoric of rationality is no guarantee of usefulness or accuracy \'97 a lesson which returns us to the debates of the eighteenth century.\

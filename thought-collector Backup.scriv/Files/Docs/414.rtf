Eve Sedgwick and, more recently, Rita Felski, among many others, have raised similar discussions about the role of emotional engagement and identification in literary scholarship. Sedgwick describes literary study which seeks to expose wide-reaching and harmful systems that underly large bodies of works as \'93paranoid reading,\'94 and introduces the idea of \'93reparative reading\'94 as an alternative. However, just as eighteenth-century writers found it easier to expose the flaws in a particular mode of thinking than to articulate a satisfying substitute, Sedgwick produces a much more detailed description of paranoid reading than of its alternative. She nonethless points to a guiding motivation of reparative reading, from which one can begin: \'93The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self.\'94 And she suggests an outcome of reparative literary scholarship, against which one can compare one\'92s findings: \'93What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture - even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them.\'94 The framework of reparative reading can thus be applied both to works of literature and to the reading practices which developed and around that literature. }

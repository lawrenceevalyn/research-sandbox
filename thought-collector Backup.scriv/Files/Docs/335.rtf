One potential chapter, for example, might examine Hannah More and William Wordsworth\'92s varying use of supernatural content and ballad forms as literary tools to \'93elevate\'94 their readers. This inquiry would consider the authors\'92 individual literary techniques, perhaps by comparing Wordsworth\'92s 1798 \'93The Thorn\'94 and More\'92s 1796 \'93Robert and Richard; Or, The Ghost of Poor Molly, Who Was Drowned In Richard\'92s Mill Pond.\'94 It would also consider the publishing context of ballads and songs generally, perhaps by using topic-modelling of the titles in the English Short Title Catalogue to identify the \'93songs\'94 for sale and exploring the use of ballads as drivers of sales. And it would consider the multiple contexts in which readers encountered ballads, not just in broadsheets and collections, but also as ephemeral social experiences, and as references or extracts in longer prose works.}

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 My plan\cb1  is to approach th\cb3 e \'93great unread\'94 of eighteenth-century literature by marrying large-scale descriptive work with meaningful interpretive insight. I will prototype different models of the literary output of my chosen decade in search of a rich, reparative reading of the literary mediascape. Each model will take a different, iterative approach to representing the complex interactions between broad generic traditions in prose fiction, drama, and poetry, and particular writers\'92 use of these interactions. One of my models will be large and distant: 51,965 bibliographic entries from the \cb1 ETSC. One model will be smaller and closer: 502 full texts from the Eighteenth Century Collections Online Text Creation Partnership (ECCO-TCP) corpus. And yet another model will occur at a more traditional scale for literary scholarship: key works by key writers, Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Turner Smith, Hannah More, and Mary Robinson, all of whom wrote prol\cb3 ifically in the period,\cb1  often as a means \cb3 to further aesthetic and political goals in a range of literary forms. \cb1 I will work with the three models\cb3  simultaneously; I want to allow each to inform the development and interpretation of the others.}

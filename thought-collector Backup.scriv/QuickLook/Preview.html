</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>what to do with so much lit?</strong><br/>My goal is to do something about the problem of literary canons. How can we cope with the sheer quantity of literature that exists? What is our goal, when we approach literature?</p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>how to select texts?</strong><br/>How do we select a small number of texts, to be “important” or “representative”, from a larger body?<br/>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>what do we teach? in what context?</strong><br/>What texts should we teach to students? And how should we contextualize them?</p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>"good" and "bad" texts</strong><br/>From my conversations with Jakob: I have two thoughts which are in tension with each other:<br/>
<br/>
1, Whenever, in literary history, there is a "gap" in which "nothing is written" -- I tend to find that actually just as much was written as usual, but it is either not in the format we expect (e.g., theatrical rather than prose production) or it is, by contemporary standards, "bad."<br/>
<br/>
1A, Whenever, in literary history, works are dismissed as "bad" -- whether his means they are morally corrupting, or poor...</p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>morally good ways of reading?</strong><br/>(Controversial opinion: I do think there are, actually, morally “good” books, or at the very least, morally good ways of reading; it is by no means the default state of all literature that it will increase empathy and understanding. Moreover, if literary scholars do not take up the task of sorting these things out, surely it can’t be someone else’s job. But also, censorship is obviously useless and wrong. So it must be the ways of reading, not the things read, which it is our responsibility to s...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>One of the ideas that was mentioned but not developed</strong><br/>One of the ideas that was mentioned but not developed at MLA was that, if one wishes to teach principles of justice, if one wishes to turn students' personal distress into pro-social empathy, one must choose to teach different texts. So I guess my question is: which eighteenth century texts should we teach? And how?<br/>
Can that be my question??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>I think Sedgwick has my answer to "why DO we study</strong><br/>I think Sedgwick has my answer to "why DO we study literature anyway" and "what makes literature so different from history":<br/>
"The desire of a reparative impulse... is additive and accretive. Its fear, a realistic one, is that the culture surrounding it is inadequate or inimical to its nurture; it wants to assemble and confer plenitude to an object that will then have resources to offer to an inchoate self."<br/>
"What we can best learn from such practices are, perhaps, the many ways selves and commun...</p>
</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>how to identify genres?</strong><br/>How do we make sense of intergeneric connections? What is a genre? Why do we have them? What are they for?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>how do literary fads move?</strong><br/>do literary fads emerge in plays, poems, and prose simultaneously, or move through them sequentially?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>how do audiences differ?</strong><br/>How different are the writers and audiences for each medium? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>what is "normal" in the 1790s?</strong><br/>What do my corpora tell us about what was ‘normal’ during my decade?<br/>
What does it mean to be “normal” or to seek the “normal” over the exceptional?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>literary triage</strong><br/>What is the goal of the field? To triage texts based on their “importance” for students to learn? To triage texts based on the social, emotional, intellectual rewards they provide their readers? Both, obviously, but: how to do either?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>how political is 1790s lit?</strong><br/>I also anticipate finding new insight into the forms and popularity of political writing in the period: how much of the work being consumed is presented with explicit political aims?</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>are they "representative"?</strong><br/>Both the macro and the micro views will merge in the question: are my key writers ‘representative’ of the popular written discourse in which they participate? What does it mean for a text to be ‘representative,’ and how should we find and understand outliers?</p>

The first part of "thinking a lot about songs," then, mostly has to do with being frustrated yet again by Lyrical Ballads' claim to glorious individual genius when their bold and original ballads!! come a good decade after, say, Robert Burns and Hannah More undertake their own ballad projects.

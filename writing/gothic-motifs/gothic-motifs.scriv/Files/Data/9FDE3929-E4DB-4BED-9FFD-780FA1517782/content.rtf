\f0\fs22 \cf0 \cb2 [The thing in past literary criticism that I wish to subject to scrutiny is the category of the Female Gothic.]}}
\f0\fs22  The \'93obviously\'94 female-associated phenomenon \cb2 [of the previously mentioned conventional narrative]\cb1  led to the critical category of the \'93Female Gothic\'94 to discuss narratives of women in patriarchal distress. Ellen Ledoux lists off the standard requirements \'97 \cb2 \'93a distressed heroine, domestic incarceration, threats of sexual violence, anxiety about monstrous or absent mothers\'94 (2) / \'93women\'92s domestic incarceration, sexual violence, economic disenfranchisement and spectral maternity\'94 (2)\cb1 . A definition based on the theme of female persecution enabled work like Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar\'92s Madwoman in the Attic (1979), Kate Ferguson Ellis\'92s The Contested Castle (1989), Eugenia DeLamotte\'92s Perils of the Night (1990), and Helene Meyers\'92s Femicidal Fears (2001) to examine specifically female experiences of the threats of patriarchy, and to take their literary depictions seriously. As their titles show, these works \cb2 [pursue [individual kinds of fears/themes/motifs] / use the particularity of [motifs?] to tie texts together.]\cb1  Concurrently, a definition based on female authorship enables Juliann Fleenor\'92s The Female Gothic (1983), Diane Long Hoeveler\'92s Gothic Feminism (1998), Emma Clery\'92s Women\'92s Gothic (2000), \cb3 [Pickering and Chatto published a 5-volume series Varieties of Female Gothic (2002)]\cb1  and Donna Heiland\'92s Gothic and Gender (2004)\cb2  [to turn their attention to gender itself / make claims on the scale of gender.]\cb1  \cb2 [Make sure to show that both things are good:\cb1  \cb3 TODO: Cite whoever it is who praises whichever text it is for its ambitious chronological breadth enabled by the Female Gothic framework]}

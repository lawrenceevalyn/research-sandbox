\f0\fs22 \cf0 \cb2 [The thing in past literary criticism that I wish to subject to scrutiny is the category of the Female Gothic.]}}
\f0\fs22  The \'93obviously\'94 female-associated phenomenon \cb2 [of the previously mentioned conventional narrative]\cb1  led to the critical category of the \'93Female Gothic\'94 to discuss narratives of women in patriarchal distress. Ellen Ledoux lists off the standard requirements \'97 \'93a distressed heroine, domestic incarceration, threats of sexual violence, anxiety about monstrous or absent mothers\'94 (2) / \'93women\'92s domestic incarceration, sexual violence, economic disenfranchisement and spectral maternity\'94 (2). \cb3 [TODO: Throw in a couple other definitions here, esp Ellen Moers]\cb1  A definition based on the theme of female persecution enabled work like Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar\'92s Madwoman in the Attic (1979), Kate Ferguson Ellis\'92s The Contested Castle (1989), Eugenia DeLamotte\'92s Perils of the Night (1990), and Helene Meyers\'92s Femicidal Fears (2001) to [take seriously \cb2 [specifically female experiences of the threats of patriarchy]]\cb1 . As their titles show, these works \cb2 [pursue [individual kinds of fears/themes/motifs] / use the particularity of [motifs?] to tie texts together.]\cb1  Concurrently,\cb2  [attention to gendered authorship][enables]\cb1  Juliann Fleenor\'92s The Female Gothic (1983), Diane Long Hoeveler\'92s Gothic Feminism (1998), Emma Clery\'92s Women\'92s Gothic (2000), \cb3 [Pickering and Chatto published a 5-volume series Varieties of Female Gothic (2002)]\cb1  and Donna Heiland\'92s Gothic and Gender (2004)\cb2  [to turn their attention to gender itself / make claims on the scale of gender.]\cb1  \cb2 [Make sure to show that both things are good:\cb1  \cb3 TODO: Cite whoever it is who praises whichever text it is for its ambitious chronological breadth enabled by the Female Gothic framework]\cb1 \

Work that complicates our image the Female Gothic \'97 like work that challenges the conventional image of Radcliffean imitators \'97  is not new. Almost as soon as the term came into use, scholars have been pushing against its boundaries, grappling with the true diversity of women\'92s Gothic {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://E5B9B2AD-583D-4F70-B6DF-412AC0EA14FA"}}{\fldrslt writing}}. Nonetheless, however, even as Gothic studies grew more complex in other ways, this definition offered something useful in identifying and providing vocabulary for a particular set of texts, so it has been impressively stable. The terms \'93Female Gothic\'94 and \'93women\'92s gothic\'94 are both in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://04E52BAB-34FB-433E-AE5F-2F869F3754B1"}}{\fldrslt currency}}. Ledoux argues persuasively that \'93the category \'91Female Gothic\'92 more accurately reflects the ideological goals of second-wave feminist literary criticism than it represents the narratives of early women Gothic writers\'94 (2) Despite many scholars\'92 work showing that \'93women\'92s early Gothic writing\'97 a great deal of which is only accessible to us because of the recovery work of feminist scholars\'97is much more aesthetically, politically, thematically, and generically diverse than the Female Gothic categorization suggests,\'94 and despite ongoing critical work to refine the term Female Gothic, she argues persuasively that \'93its usage has limited the ways in which scholars approach women\'92s Gothic writing\'94 (2). Ledoux set out to \'93to explain why the discrepancy between available primary textual material and textual analysis exists and how it came to be,\'94 (2) a task which she accomplishes successfully through a carefully close-read history of nineteenth and twentieth century literary politics. \cb2 [I explore a \'93middle zone\'94 between primary material and history-of-criticism (bibliography)] [My goal is to take up the work of correcting these discrepancies.]}

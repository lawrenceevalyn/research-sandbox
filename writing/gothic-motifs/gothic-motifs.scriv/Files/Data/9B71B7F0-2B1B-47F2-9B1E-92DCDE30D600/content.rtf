\f0\fs22 \cf0 Instead of telling us about gender, then, the most prevalent tags highlight the multiplicity of interpretation built into Frank\'92s \'93gothic types\'94. The tags \'93mode\'94 and \'93elements,\'94 for example, are each applied to 27% of all works in the sample. These terms appear as qualifiers for his other assessments, as in \'93terror mode\'94 or \'93sentimental elements,\'94 and accordingly remind us to modify the implied force of \'93terror\'94 and \'93sentimental\'94 as tags. Indeed, many of Frank\'92s tags are essentially qualifiers: \'93mode\'94, \'93effects\'94, \'93Gothified\'94, and \'93imitation,\'94 for example. In Frank\'92s Gothic typology, then, the Gothic is not monolithic: each work assembles multiple elements, which have their sources elsewhere, and are all interconnected. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://78015818-051E-4066-A715-A60118435993"}}{\fldrslt \cb2 Nothing for Frank is just one genre.}}\cb2   \cb1 Even horror and terror are far from mutually exclusive. Of the remaining 27 works which are purely horror, no terror, there are 9 by women, 9 by men, and 9 unknown \cb2 [\cb3 1.38\cb2 ] \cb1 \'97 a far cry from the horror Gothic as the exclusive province of men. Of all 53 \'93horror\'94 works, 26 (49%) are also tagged \'93terror\'94. These 26 horror-terror works are \cb2 50% by men (\cb3 2.24\cb2  times more likely to be male)\cb1 , making the horror-terror mode more predictive of male authorship than horror alone. The only part that\'92s consistent with the conventional narrative is that terror vastly outnumbers horror.

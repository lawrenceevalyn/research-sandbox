\f0\fs22 \cf0 I take Tracy\'92s model to its logical extension by foregrounding her motifs. I distilled her index of 208 motifs into 92 motifs which appear in at least 20 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://E6F6D1B2-3F9D-486E-B473-47D87F53F781"}}{\fldrslt works}}, as seen in Figure <$n#figs:allMotifs>. Using her model to investigate the possibility of a women\'92s Gothic, I examine the potential predictive power of each motif. I ask whether the presence of any given motif in a work constitutes meaningful information regarding the probable gender of that work\'92s author. In contrast to the ambiguity of Frank\'92s tags, Tracy\'92s motifs immediately point to a gendered school: 38 distinctly male-authored {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://922FA844-05D0-499D-9FA4-4A07B7CA0DB3"}}{\fldrslt motifs}} describe a men\'92s Gothic, defined by extreme horror tropes.}

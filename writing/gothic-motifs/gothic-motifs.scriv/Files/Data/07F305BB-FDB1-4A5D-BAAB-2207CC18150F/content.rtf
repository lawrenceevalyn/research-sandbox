\f0\fs22  \'97 are thus themselves models of \'93The Gothic Novel.\'94 Because, as Price observes, the process of editing a text must always reveal the editor\'92s \'93unspoken assumptions about the most efficient way to convey information, and indeed what counts as information at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://0EC83037-5D1E-4616-A9C2-9D6BD89792DE"}}{\fldrslt all,\'94}} the editorial processes behind each bibliography makes each one sensitive to very different {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://80B3B4F4-B8BB-44AC-95ED-1DC54F538C11"}}{\fldrslt concerns.}} Ann Tracy\'92s The Gothic Novel 1790-1830: Plot Summaries and Index to Motifs emphasizes dramatic events and singular images, with recurring details systematically tallied in the index. In contrast, Frederick Frank\'92s The First Gothics: A Critical Guide to the English Gothic Novel emphasizes each work\'92s overall tone and provides qualitative and subtle evaluations of its critical reception. Although only 178 works are shared between the two, they usefully complement each other in the search for gendered Gothic writing traditions. The process of computationally re-rendering each bibliography amplifies each bibliographer\'92s choices, allowing me to see whether their distinctions are fruitful, and whether their models point toward distinct men\'92s and women\'92s Gothics.}

\f0\fs22 \cf0 By asking whether \cb2 [I can actually find a difference]\cb1  between books written by women and books written by men, \cb2 [at scale]\cb1 , \cb2 [I occupy a very particular position re: gender.]\cb1  First, I shift the terms of the conversation so that it is authors, rather than texts or narrative techniques, which have genders:\cb2  [not a male or female gothic, but men\'92s and women\'92s gothics.] \cb1 This is more than mere semantics.\cb2  [I reject the spotting of \'93female gothic\'94 elements that appear in texts regardless of authorial gender; such things as terror, explained supernatural, Whatever Robert Miles Talks About, etc, all exist, but since they exist in works regardless of authorial gender I reject the attempt to impose a gender on them.] [They may well have been gendered in the minds of 18thC audiences but we can try to leave those biases behind.] \cb1 By continuing to seek gendered trends, and re-focusing on the authors as the source of gendered interpretation, I realise that I appear to risk falling back into a gender essentialism that is even less useful than\cb2  [the textual frameworks of male and female gothics.] [But, first, it is my question rather than my conclusion, to ask whether men and women wrote differently.] [And, second, if I do find such a difference, I will take this as a reflection of social constraints on the lived experiences of men and women in the eighteenth century, rather than biological essentialism.] [It is possible that women had special license to express certain politics / sympathies \cb3 [TODO: cite someone on this in a footnote]\cb2 . [It is equally possible men had special license to write gross books.] \cb3 [TODO: cite someone on this in a footnote] \cb2 [Either finding would support a \'93women\'92s gothic\'94 or \'93men\'92s gothic\'94 in which authorial gender shaped a work\'92s creation, but according to the particular context and social pressures of late eighteenth century gender norms, not due to differences that are inherent or universal.] [Thus, I research gender while avoiding gender essentialism.]}

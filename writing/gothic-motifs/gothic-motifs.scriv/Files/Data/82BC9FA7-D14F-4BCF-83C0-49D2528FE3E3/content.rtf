\f0\fs22 \cf0 Over the course of three literary experiments, in which I model the early Gothic novel by means of bibliographic records, I ask whether the hundreds of women writing Gothic novels wrote observably different books than the hundreds of men doing the same. This project ultimately reinforces Ledoux\'92s argument that the Female Gothic is a retroactive critical creation. Frederick Frank\'92s critical categories paint a picture of Radcliffe as the centre of a group of female, sentimental copiers. But Ann Tracy\'92s less-critically-mediated details present us with a largely undifferentiated gothic mainstream, in which the only gendered pocket is a group of male writers whose gender gives them license to go to extremes. \cb2 [Hint to classifier experiments?] [Add more emphasis to my major claim, which follows in the next sentence?]\cb1  {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://28F0537F-FDD8-4502-9F82-5EFA255276E4"}}{\fldrslt In the field of Gothic studies, this work suggests that we can fold the \'93female Gothic\'94 into the unmarked category of \'93the Gothic mainstream,\'94 and begin an exploration of a \'93men\'92s Gothic.\'94 }}Because Frank and Tracy support such different conclusions \cb2 [based on ostensibly the same body of texts]\cb1 , my work also suggests\cb2  [that we need increased skepticism of the biases built into the very data-collection of all research]] [Connect to broader context: must always remember that \'93data\'94 is in fact \'93capta,\'94 even/especially \'93data\'94 which does not present itself as such.

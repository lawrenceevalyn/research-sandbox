\f0\fs22 \cf0 Work that complicates our image the Female Gothic \'97 like work that challenges the conventional image of Radcliffean imitators \'97  is not new. Almost as soon as the term came into use, scholars have been pushing against its boundaries, grappling with the true diversity of women\'92s Gothic {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://46D8248B-9ED6-42EF-B1D9-BB8B09A524D0"}}{\fldrslt writing}}. Nonetheless, however, even as Gothic studies grew more complex in other ways, this definition offered something useful in identifying and providing vocabulary for a particular set of texts, so it has been impressively stable. The terms \'93Female Gothic\'94 and \'93women\'92s gothic\'94 are both in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://3CAFE1DC-F01F-48AF-AD73-9AA9B791777D"}}{\fldrslt currency}}. Ledoux argues persuasively that \'93the category \'91Female Gothic\'92 more accurately reflects the ideological goals of second-wave feminist literary criticism than it represents the narratives of early women Gothic {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://A6567F30-A1D2-4F3C-ACCC-62546CDDEFC2"}}{\fldrslt writers.\'94}} Despite many scholars\'92 work showing that \'93women\'92s early Gothic writing\'97 a great deal of which is only accessible to us because of the recovery work of feminist scholars\'97is much more aesthetically, politically, thematically, and generically diverse than the Female Gothic categorization suggests,\'94 and despite ongoing critical work to refine the term Female Gothic, she finds that \'93its usage has limited the ways in which scholars approach women\'92s Gothic {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://C908F106-FF8D-4950-9E4F-A20CCCEE3947"}}{\fldrslt writing.\'94}} Ledoux set out to \'93to explain why the discrepancy between available primary textual material and textual analysis exists and how it came to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://19129AC6-FDC7-40A3-AAB9-AAE0BCACBF36"}}{\fldrslt be,\'94}} a task which she accomplishes successfully through a carefully close-read history of nineteenth and twentieth century literary politics. \cb2 [I explore a \'93middle zone\'94 between primary material and history-of-criticism (bibliography)] [My goal is to take up the work of correcting these discrepancies.]}

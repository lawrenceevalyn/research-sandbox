\f0\fs22 \cf0 The long history and continuing use of the Female Gothic framework stands in a striking contrast to the dearth of work on the Male Gothic. Even though the Gothic is a context in which men are assumed to be famously outnumbered, the status of \'93male\'94 as a cultural default means their works are \'93unmarked\'94 or assumed to be defined by things other than gender. The Female Gothic is often treated as synonymous with the explained supernatural, or the \'91terror\'92 mode in the terror/horror distinction, but no terminology is used for the \'91unexplained supernatural,\'92 and horror works by men are called \'91horror\'92, rather than Male Gothic. The few explicit identifications of a male mode of writing begin with the female and define the male as its lack or opposite. Ellen Ledoux, for example, in the context of attaching the Female Gothic to \'93the \'91explained supernatural style,\'92\'94 adds a definition for the Male Gothic, \'93in which ghosts, devils and other supernatural phenomena demand a willful suspension of disbelief from the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://9BD9E93C-47E4-404F-83C5-CB7D39CF0DBB"}}{\fldrslt reader.\'94}} David Richter provides definitions based on plot structures: \'93The \'91female Gothic\'92 is \'85 a melodrama arousing sympathy and suspense through the unwarranted persecution of an innocent.

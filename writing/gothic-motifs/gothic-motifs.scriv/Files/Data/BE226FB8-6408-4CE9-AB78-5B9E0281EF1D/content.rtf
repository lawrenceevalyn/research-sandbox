\f0\fs22 \cf0 Based on my findings, I suggest that our attention to gender has been exactly the opposite of what is supported by the variety of texts produced under the Gothic umbrella. Although there are many Gothic features which are strongly predictive of male authorship, I find nothing that is the exclusive province of women. [I contradict the claim that \'93it is rare for male authors to write in the \'93female\'94 style (Miles, 2000)\'94 (Ledoux 3)] [I was deciding between two theories: Women have special license to express certain politics / sympathies? Men have special license to write gross books? I set aside the first matter (I can\'92t detect anything notably feminine), but find strong support for the second. Men have special license to be weird and gross.] }

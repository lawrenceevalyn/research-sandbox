\f0\fs30 \cf0 This motif-based model of the early Gothic suggests that, rather than a balanced oppositions of Radcliffe\'92s female terror Gothic versus Lewis\'92s male horror Gothic, the genre as a popular movement was defined by a less-sensationalist (possibly Radcliffean, possibly terror-mode) non-gendered Gothic mainstream, with a subset of male horror Gothic writers making up a minor tradition within it. These results serve as a useful reminder that not all contrasts are perfect binaries; the existence of a men\'92s Gothic tradition does not require that everything outside that tradition be a perfectly-opposed women\'92s Gothic.}

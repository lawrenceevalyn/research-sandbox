My graphic design choices, as I sought to render each chart legible in terms of this driving question, followed similar principles as my motif chart designs, particularly the use of colour contrast to indicate gendered difference. 
\f1 Because each chart was specialized to a particular sub-question, each chart has its own slightly different procedure, designed in accordance with the questions that the chart is meant to answer. Across all the charts based on Frank\'92s information, stacked bar graphs let me compare varying numbers of elements. Showing the raw counts, rather than scaled percentages, allows the size of each bar to convey the relative prevalence of each tag. Although the limitations of Microsoft Excel meant that I had to eyeball the sizes, the width of one book in a bar graph is consistent across all the graphs, allowing them to be accurately compared to each other. }

\f0\fs22 \cf0 Adapting Frank\'92s model for my own, then, required working somewhat against the grain of his assumptions. However, I have avoided simply assigning each text one \cf2 single\cf0  genre. Instead, I have separated out each strand of influence within his complex \'93Gothic types\'94  by dividing each \'93type\'94 into a set of tags, and tallied the uses of each {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://40A71AA1-AC4F-4C83-88DE-25B4DCC306F5"}}{\fldrslt tag.}} This process generated 190 unique tags, most of which only apply to one or two works. By rendering the tags individually listable, my model imposes a more systematic ontology than Frank\'92s. However, because each work is \'93tagged\'94 numerous times, my model retains the details of each work\'92s often-idiosyncratic combinations of influences. My approach treats each \'93tag\'94 as an independent object of inquiry, informative of one small facet of a work\'92s participation in its generic context. I ask whether the association of a given tag with a work constitutes meaningful information regarding the probable gender of that work\'92s author.}

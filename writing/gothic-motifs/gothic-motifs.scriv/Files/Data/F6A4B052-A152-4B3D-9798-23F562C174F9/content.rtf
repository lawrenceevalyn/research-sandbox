\f0\fs22 \cf2 [Transition from Frank.] \cf0 Tracy\'92s bibliography is built to be more like a particularly helpful finding aid than a comprehensive check-list.  Her most unusual qualitative bibliographical work is her ten-page \'93Index to Motifs\cf2 ,\cf0 \'94 \cf2 which identifies\cf0  the books in which 208 different \'93motifs\'94 appear. Tracy uses the term \'93motif\'94 broadly to encompass a wide range of plot elements, images, and character types. \cf2 Unlike Frank\'92s highly-variable \'93Gothic types,\'94 these motifs are already systematically standardized. \cf0 The index is intended for \'93scholars with particular {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://6CB3EB1B-E36E-471D-8756-92C497767EE7"}}{\fldrslt interests\'94}}, who wish to locate and read books containing individual story elements, such as \'93doppelganger\'94 or \'93garden as scene of temptation\cf2 .\cf0 \'94 Accordingly, Tracy prioritizes presenting a wide range of highly distinctive motifs rather than those that constitute the norm. Indeed, she intentionally exclude\cf2 s\cf0  the most popular motifs: \'93the abundance of murders,\'94 she says, \'93argued for the retention\'85 of specialized murders {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://5869E3B6-CC5D-4D09-95EB-E03C6F171234"}}{\fldrslt only,\'94}} and castles have similarly been ig\cf3 n\cf0 ored. In addition to the motifs, Tracy provides a plot summary of each novel. Her summaries, too, emphasize distinctive details, pointing out things like \'93a particularly interesting Satan, with molten {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://A1FEF1BB-D563-4DDB-86C9-A2556F420192"}}{\fldrslt insides\cf2 .\cf0 \'94}} \cf2 She makes no mention of the critical assessments or literary intertextuality which make up the majority of Frank\'92s synopses. \cf0 As a model of the Gothic, \cf2 then, \cf0 Tracy\'92s bibliography elides continuities \cf2 between novels \cf0 to increase its sensitivity to points of difference. It treats each novel as a collection of discrete elements, only one of which is likely to be of interest to a given scholar. The motifs themselves \'97 Satans, murders, doppelgangers, gardens \'97 are thus constructed as the stable objects of study, which must be examined through the filter of individual novels.}

More than half of the motifs under consideration are not strongly gendered in either direction: [\cb2 as with Frank, we primarily see a Gothic mainstream / almost tautologically, the Gothic mainstream/majority is defined by\'85 the mainstream]\cb1 . Four motifs are even perfect ties: elopement (all subcategories); duelling and other single combat; fainting, female; and rediscovery of lost relatives. Moreover, the more popular a motif is \'97 that is, the larger a role it plays in constituting the default expectations of the genre \'97 the more likely it is to be non-gendered. Indeed, all of the strongly male-dominated motifs are much less common than the more neutral motifs. As with Frank, the neutrality of the most popular motifs is essentially a mathematical inevitability: nothing can achieve more than 50% popularity while being used by only 50% of authors. The Gothic mainstream must be defined by that which is available to all authors within the genre. In terms of sheer prevalence, the defining features of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://091D65AF-F81D-441F-8C65-E02357AC05BB"}}{\fldrslt Gothic}} appear to be fainting (present in 77% of all novels), confinement (66% of novels), abduction (57%), references to suicide (47%), and storms (44%). Only one of those five motifs, suicide (61% male), shows hints of a gendered divide. \cb2 [Conclude with some kind of argument: I feel like I\'92m contradicting myself \'97 is my argument that the Gothic is basically ungendered, or is it that we need to pay attention to the Men\'92s Gothic?? Earlier I said that \'93this work suggests that we can fold the \'93female Gothic\'94 into the unmarked category of \'93the Gothic mainstream,\'94 and begin an exploration of a \'93men\'92s Gothic.\'94\'94 Also: rich description is fruitful when the \'93capta\'94 are more explicit.]}

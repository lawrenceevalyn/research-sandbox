\f0\fs22 \cf0 What makes Tracy\'92s data different from Frank\'92s data is that, although \'93motifs\'94 are qualitative information, they are nonetheless replicable. Other scholars can identify how Tracy would have assessed an individual text, and add that text to the corpus. Neither Frank nor Tracy intended their assessments to be removed from their original context for the kind of corpus analysis I have carried out here, but this is true of much metadata which is used for large-scale humanities study. I argue, based on my work here, that it is often, but not 
\i always
\i0 , possible to repurpose metadata to ask questions its creators never intended, including with highly qualitative metadata. I argue, further, than the repurposable metadata will be distinguishably by its replicability. This metric is, in fact, a borrowing from computer science: in a well-formed training sample, multiple humans will be asked to classify the training data. Only classifications which humans agree on will be used as the foundation for machine classification.}

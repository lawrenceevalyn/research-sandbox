The transition between the first and second pars feel like a big jump, mostly because it seems like there should have been a par in between laying out some kind of plan. You do, ofc, in the second par outline your claims, but because it\'92s at once a \'93my claims\'94 and \'93methodology\'94 par, it packs in quite a bit. Would it be helpful to have another par after the first devoted to the article\'92s aims, what it will accomplish, and then a methodology par?\cf4 \
\cf2 \'a0Another reason why I wanted this par to be two pars is because of the fascinating claims about gender. This is the sentence that really struck me: \'93
\f1 Given the social reality of gender, it does not require gender essentialism to hypothesize that men and women might have [different horizons of publishability].\'94
\f0 \'a0I wanted to hear more about this idea.\cf4 \

\f1 \cf5 Could open up more to 18C scholars, maybe by relating the Gothic more to 18C lit at large and contextualizing the significance of Tracy and Frank for those scholars.}]]></Comment>

\f0\fs22 \cf0 [This paper asks how to identify and discuss gendered trends.] This paper examines more than five hundred pre-Victorian Gothic works to ask whether female writers created categorically different works than their male peers, [looking for predictive power.] Two qualitative bibliographies of the Gothic provide \'93motifs\'94 and \'93Gothic types\'94 for computational modelling.  [There\'92s no female gothic, but there might be a male gothic.]}

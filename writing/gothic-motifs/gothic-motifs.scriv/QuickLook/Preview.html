<p class="itemTitle">anecdote: Northanger Novels</p>
<p class="itemText">Jane Austen’s beloved novel-about-novels, Northanger Abbey, written in the late 1790s but not published until after her death in 1817, paints a familiar picture of women’s Gothic reading at the end of the eighteenth century. Isabella Thorpe has introduced naive and impressionable Catherine Morland to the world of new novels, which present an absorbing alternative to the much older Sir Charles Grandison (1753) that constitutes Catherine’s mother’s primary novel-reading. Isabella has begun Catheri...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">mass of Radcliffean imitators</p>
<p class="itemText">(Somehow also get at the idea that this kind of argument-by-corpus is also a microcosm of my own argument-by-corpus?)]The Northanger novels constitute an argument-by-corpus about the “excessive” Gothic novel of the 1790s. In this narrative, Ann Radcliffe, the “Great Enchantress,” enthrals audiences for a decade with literary blockbusters which are gobbled up by women who scribble their own novels in response. The marketplace is glutted with these unskilled copies of Radcliffe, written by authore...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">connection to broader field</p>
<p class="itemText">It is necessary for new knowledge to be built upon the foundations of former knowledge; but equally it is necessary to re-investigate the truth of what is “known.” This project revives two qualitative bibliographies from the 1980s to seek gendered patterns of writing among hundreds of early Gothic texts. I am particularly interested in trends that could have predictive power: rather than speculating about a book’s meaning based on its author’s gender, I set out to ask whether, in fact, there is ...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">history of the Female Gothic</p>
<p class="itemText">[My context here is the Female Gothic.] The “obviously” female-associated phenomenon of Gothic excess led to the critical category of the “Female Gothic” to discuss narratives of women in patriarchal distress. Ellen Ledoux lists off the standard requirements: “a distressed heroine, domestic incarceration, threats of sexual violence, anxiety about monstrous or absent mothers,” and “economic disenfranchisement” (2). A definition based on the theme of female persecution enabled work like Sandra Gil...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Male Gothic less often / well defined</p>
<p class="itemText">The continuing use of the Female Gothic framework stands in a striking contrast to the dearth of work on the Male Gothic. Even though the Gothic is a context in which men are assumed to be famously outnumbered, the status of “male” as a cultural default means their works are “unmarked” or assumed to be defined by things other than gender. The Female Gothic is often treated as synonymous with the explained supernatural, or the ‘terror’ mode in the terror/horror distinction, but no terminology is ...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">critique of Female Gothic</p>
<p class="itemText">Work that complicates our image the Female Gothic — like work that challenges the conventional image of Radcliffean imitators —  is not new. Almost as soon as the term came into use, scholars have been pushing against its boundaries, grappling with the true diversity of women’s Gothic writing. Nonetheless, however, even as Gothic studies grew more complex in other ways, this definition offered something useful in identifying and providing vocabulary for a particular set of texts, so it has been ...</p>

<p class="itemText">By asking whether [I can actually find a difference] between books written by women and books written by men, at scale beyond individual reading, [I occupy a very particular position re: gender.] First, I shift the terms of the conversation so that it is authors, rather than texts or narrative techniques, which have genders: not a male or female gothic, but men’s and women’s gothics. This is more than mere semantics. [I reject the drive to identify “female gothic” elements that appear in texts r...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">theory: my bibs have thin description</p>
<p class="itemText">My methods emphasize the continuities between computational approaches to literature and the the venerable tradition of archival bibliographical research. Heather Love has notably turned to sociological microanalysis as a model for 'thin description' close-but-not-deep reading methods; I employ qualitative computational modelling as another method which seeks the same goals. Love emphasizes thin description as not just “fine-grained” but “exhaustive” (and possibly exhausting) but with the reward...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">I'm modelling here</p>
<p class="itemText">Johanna Drucker has given compelling warnings about the dangers of treating constructed information as empirically objective “data” which may then be passively “visualized”. Willard McCarty’s discussion of models as both “pragmatic” and “fictive” is more accurate to the scholarly process of gathering, classifying, correlating, and interpreting information. Whether a model is a reading or a bar chart, the worth of that model must be judged by its “fruitfulness”, a term for which Stephen Ramsay pr...</p>

<p class="itemText">Over the course of three literary experiments, in which I model the early Gothic novel by means of bibliographic records, I ask whether the hundreds of women writing Gothic novels wrote observably different books than the hundreds of men doing the same. This project ultimately reinforces Ledoux’s argument that the Female Gothic is a retroactive critical creation. Frederick Frank’s critical categories paint a picture of Radcliffe as the centre of a group of female, sentimental copiers. But Ann Tr...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Frank's model</p>
<p class="itemText">Frederick Frank has been a dedicated bibliographer of the Gothic since long before it acquired its mantle of academic seriousness. He has compiled three editions of Guide to The Gothic: An Annotated Bibliography of Criticism, in 1984, 1995, and 2005, in addition to numerous specialized bibliographies on individual authors or texts. The First Gothics: A Critical Guide to the English Gothic Novel was published in 1987, on the heels of his first bibliography of criticism, and provides detailed list...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">my model of Frank</p>
<p class="itemText">Adapting Frank’s model for my own, then, required working somewhat against the grain of his assumptions. However, I have avoided over-reducing his work by simply assigning each text one single genre. Instead, I have separated out each strand of influence within his complex “Gothic types”  by dividing each “type” into a set of tags, and tallied the uses of each tag. This process generated 190 unique tags, most of which only apply to one or two works. By rendering the tags individually listable, m...</p>

<p class="itemText">For the most part, however, Frank’s bibliography resists division into a gendered binary. As Figure <$n#figs:popularFranks> shows, the two most prevalent tags in the corpus as a whole are “Gothic” (83% of all works) [1.01 times more female] and “pure/h...</p>

<p class="itemText">Mathematically, of course, the norm is always going to be dominated by that which both sexes can participate in.

With this limit in mind, we can look at tags for which women or men are overrepresented by examining at their odds ratios.] [EXPLAIN ODDS RATIOS. 43% of Frank’s corpus is written by women, but that 43% is responsible for 50% of the “terror” works, 65% of the “Radcliffean...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Tracy's model</p>
<p class="itemText">Ann Tracy’s name, unlike Frank’s, is unlikely to be familiar to Gothicists; this bibliography appears to be her only publication on the Gothic. A review of the bibliography says that “The audience of specialists for whom this interesting work of scholarship is primarily intended will find in it nothing that is deep but much that is useful” Her bibliography is built to be more like a particularly helpful finding aid than a comprehensive check-list.  Her most unusual qualitative bibliographical wo...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">my model of Tracy</p>
<p class="itemText">I take Tracy’s model to its logical extension by foregrounding her motifs. I distilled her index of 208 motifs into 92 motifs which appear in at least 20 works, as seen in Figure <$n#figs:allMotifs>. Using her model to investigate the possibility of a women’s Gothic, I examine the potential predictive power of each motif. I ask whether the presence of any given motif in a work constitutes meaningful information regarding the probable gender of that work’s author. In contrast to the ambiguity of ...</p>

<p class="itemText">Comparing these male-dominated motifs to the neutral or female-dominated motifs, as seen in Figure <$n#figs:genderedMotifs>, involves constant escalation. Women may write about libertines (64% female), whose seductions may be coercive and almost always end poorly for their victims, but men write about the act of rape itself (75% male).

<p class="itemTitle">women's Gothic</p>
<p class="itemText">In contrast to this abundance of male-dominated tropes, female-authored tropes are elusive. Instead, in Tracy’s model of the genre, the women’s Gothic seems to be defined by only four things: libertines (64% female), forced weddings (62% female), sad or pious deaths (61% female), and miniature portraits (61% female). It is easy to start drawing conclusions from these findings, inventing the binary opposites of the conclusions we drew about Frank. The libertines and miniature portraits in particu...</p>

<p class="itemText">More than half of the motifs under consideration are not strongly gendered in either direction: [as with Frank, we primarily see a Gothic mainstream / almost tautologically, the Gothic mainstream/majority is defined by… the mainstream]. Four motifs are even perfect ties: elopement (all subcategories); duelling and other single combat; fainting, female; and rediscovery of lost relatives. Moreover, the more popular a motif i...</p>

<p class="itemText">It is possible to computationally test the question of “can this information be used to classify these items according to these categories?” using machine learning. “Supervised” machine learning uses a training set of data that has already been classified into the relevant categories to develop a classification algorithm which will replicate the original identifications. The accuracy of the resulting algorithm can be evaluated using cross-validation, which iteratively trains a classifier on part...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">we go too far with small samples</p>
<p class="itemText">It is tantalizingly tempting, with small samples, to draw conclusions.  [After all, we’re good at analysis / pattern-matching / filling in gaps.] [But these conclusions aren’t true.] Complaints about small sample sizes in the social sciences are more than just lip service: an experiment with a too-small sample will look like a meaningful experiment, offering up results ripe for interpretation; [the problem is that these results are probably false.] In the case of this classifier experiment, Fran...</p>

<p class="itemText">[The other thing we learned from the classifier is that it is tantalizingly tempting to continue onward with someone else’s implicit bias.] [Frank was (marginally) more accurate because his “capta” were captured in a way that was implicitly shaped by his knowledge of authorial gender — which creates a classifier that will do better on its tests, but which can’t handle new information that is captured without Frank’s specific, individual, implicit bias.] My computer scientist collaborator express...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">verifiability</p>
<p class="itemText">What makes Tracy’s data different from Frank’s data is that, although “motifs” are qualitative information, they are nonetheless replicable. Other scholars can identify how Tracy would have assessed an individual text, and add that text to the corpus. Neither Frank nor Tracy intended their assessments to be removed from their original context for the kind of corpus analysis I have carried out here, but this is true of much metadata which is used for large-scale humanities study. I argue, based o...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">conclusion: women aren't weird, men are</p>
<p class="itemText">Based on my findings, I suggest that our attention to gender has been exactly the opposite of what is supported by the variety of texts produced under the Gothic umbrella. Although there are some Gothic features which are strongly predictive of male authorship, I find nothing that is the exclusive province of women.

## Notes

"Interested parties should know that their topic would be entirely their decision as long as it falls within the category of fiction about labour. We are not limiting texts by genre, region or era, but we do ask that presenters choose a novel with wide appeal, likely known to an engaged but non-scholarly audience."

I think a very interesting conversation about labour could be had taking one of Jane Austen's novels as its subject: her novels are intimately about economics while also only marginally acknowledging the role of labourers. A great deal of excellent scholarly work as been done on, for example, how Austen's novels reflect the changes to the British working world brought about by the Enclosure Acts (which turned working land into decorative land). Mansfield Park in particular would allow for a conversation about the eighteenth century British slave trade. Or Persuasion would allow a conversation about the British navy as an employer which was uniquely both meritocratic and "respectable." Austen is of course an eternally popular author, and taking this opportunity to discuss her could introduce readers to one of her somewhat lesser-read works, and provide a new context for understanding them.

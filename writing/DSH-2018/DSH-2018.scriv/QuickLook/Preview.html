<p class="itemText">Genre, as one of the perennially difficult questions of literary study, is a ubiquitous subject for computational “distant reading” of literature. [Cite Daniel Chandler re: what’s hard about genre, what our goal is with genre.] [Explain what distant reading is, try to get Jockers and Hoover in here.]</p>

<p class="itemTitle">TEI parser</p>
<p class="itemText">Examining network graphs requires, first, a substantial body of network graphs. Many scholars have handmade theatrical network graphs, both as wholly artistic interpretations (Moretti) and as mathematically-expressed networks (Trilcke et al., Fischer et al.). Like the Digital Literary Network Analysis (dlina) working group, we acquire our networks by parsing plays which have been encoded according to the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standards. Our parser takes in a TEI-encoded play, extracts c...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">classifiers</p>
<p class="itemText">We then used our generated network graphs to test our central question: whether character speech interaction can be used to distinguish between the dramatic genres of tragedy, comedy, and history. We decided that the answer would be “yes” if we could train a classifier to replicate the First Folio’s classifications for Shakespeare’s 36 plays. We tested three classifier algorithms with fivefold cross-validation, using 21 different mathematical features as the metrics for comparison. We found that...</p>

<p class="itemText">[Signpost that I’m going to get to the problem plays]</p>
<p class="itemText">genre has something to do with relations between characters (not something that people have necessarily said); the idea that comedy is about social connection is not new, but that it can be mapped by the way characters relate on the stage is different and interesting.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">comedies</p>
<p class="itemText">Comedies are, it turns out, the most straightforward networks to identify. They have fewer nodes, with high graph density. Although comedies often have multiple subplots, we find that these separate stories do not result in highly-separated networks. We theorize that comedic networks are strongly shaped by the final “resolution” scenes, which bring the cast together for a restoration of social order, and therefore create edges knitting the network together. (See, for example, A Midsummer Night’s...</p>

<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">comedies are really simple. ok, and now let's look at what this does when things get complicated." (or at least signpost then that we're gonna come back to the problem/romance plays) -- our way of reading is that tragedies are the least clear: it might look like they're similar to histories (explain math), but there's something else with density (more math), and what's really interesting is the way it makes us look at the plays</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">tragedies look really close to histories, which makes sense for h...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">histories</p>
<p class="itemText">In contrast, histories feature highly dispersed networks, with large numbers of very minor characters, such as “First,” “Second,” and “Third” members of groups like soldiers and ambassadors, who each interject briefly in a single scene. Connections form chains of acquaintance with little overlap, so even the monarchs have low eigenvector centrality. Whereas the directional edges in comedies tended to be reciprocal and balanced, in histories they are often unidirectional, as characters give order...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">tragedies</p>
<p class="itemText">Tragedies are more formally unpredictable, and sit somewhere ambiguously between comedies and histories. Many have a dense core with a secondary ring of more peripheral characters. Many have a node who forms a distinct, singular centre of the network, connected to a large number of nodes that are only sparsely connected to each other. Directional edges are, as in histories, often unreciprocated, and the “tragic hero” nodes are particularly likely to have very heavily weighted edges connecting ou...</p>

<p class="itemText">As Figure <$n#fig:problem-plays> shows, both classifiers generally concur with the First Folio’s classification of the “problem plays,” with the exception that the SVM classifier identifies Troilus and Cressida as a comedy rather than a tragedy.

<p class="itemTitle">Winter's Tale</p>
<p class="itemText">The Winter’s Tale provides a particularly useful case study for close-reading a play through the lens of its social network. The play earns its designation as a “romance” due to its two-part structure: the first X acts play like a tragedy, in which Leontes gradually ruins his own life. At the beginning of Act X, the character of “Time” comes on stage to declare that XX years have passed, and the play begins an extended pastoral comedy which ultimately resolves all the looming tragedies of the be...</p>

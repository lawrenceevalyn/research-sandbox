<p class="itemText">Genre, as one of the perennially difficult questions of literary study, is a ubiquitous subject for computational “distant reading” of literature. Daniel Chandler, in setting out many of the “perennial doubts [that] plague genre theory” (1) notes as one source of difficulty that “[p]articular features which are characteristic of a genre are not normally unique to it; it is their relative prominence, combination and functions which are distinctive” (2). Nonetheless, genres certainly exist. Distan...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">TEI parser</p>
<p class="itemText">Examining network graphs requires, first, a substantial body of network graphs. Many scholars have handmade theatrical network graphs, both as wholly artistic interpretations (Moretti) and as mathematically-expressed networks (Trilcke et al., Fischer et al.). Like the Digital Literary Network Analysis (dlina) working group, we acquire our networks by parsing plays which have been encoded according to the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standards. Our parser takes in a TEI-encoded play, extracts c...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">classifiers</p>
<p class="itemText">We then used our generated network graphs to test our central question: whether character speech interaction can be used to distinguish between the dramatic genres of tragedy, comedy, and history. We decided that the answer would be “yes” if we could train a classifier to replicate the First Folio’s classifications for Shakespeare’s 36 plays. We tested three classifier algorithms with fivefold cross-validation, using 21 different mathematical features as the metrics for comparison. We found that...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">genres</p>
<p class="itemText">The ability of the classifier to replicate the First Folio’s designations with substantially greater than random chance supports our initial hypothesis that the genre of a play is expressed in the relations it stages between its characters. The underlying details that drive the classification can also provide a new lens into the specific genres and character staging of of Shakespeare’s works. Beginning with the clearest results and moving into the realm of more ambiguous interpretation, we will ...</p>

<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">As Table <$n#table:genre-stats> below suggests, comedies are the most straightforward networks to identify. Whereas histories and tragedies often have similar values across our metrics, comedies tend to be distinct. Their smaller casts are more interconnected, which can be visually observed in Figure <$n#fig:all-comedies> above, and can be measured in their networks’ h...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">history/tragedy ambiguity</p>
<p class="itemText">What Table <$n#table:genre-stats> above also suggests is that histories and tragedies are fairly similar genres. We interpret these results by understanding histories as representing one end of a spectrum which has comedies on the opposite end, with tragedies falling between histories and comedies.  </p>

<p class="itemText">Figure <$n:fig:all-histories>: Networks graphs of all First Folio histories.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Histories, as can be visually seen in in Figure <$n#fig:all-histories>, feature large and highly dispersed networks. Their peripheries are populated with large numbers of very minor characters, such as “First,” “Second,” and “Third” members of groups like soldiers and ambassadors, who each interject briefly in a single scene. (See, for example, Figure <$n#fig:richard3>, Richard III, and for an extreme example Figure <$...</p>

<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Tragedies are more formally unpredictable, especially visually, as seen in Figure <$n#fig:all-tragedies>. Many have a dense core with a secondary ring of more peripheral characters. (See, for example,  Many have a node who forms a distinct, singular centre of the network, connected to a large number of nodes that are only sparsely connected to e...</p>

<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Much of the difficulty in identify genre in the first place stems from genre’s slippery status. Even in evaluating accuracy, we really determine the classifier’s ability to predict how the First Folio would have labelled a work, not the work’s “true” and objective genre. Shakespearean scholars by no means universally accept the First Folio’s assignments. Accordingly, once we had trained our SVM classifier, we que...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="itemText">As Table <$n#table:problem-plays> shows, both classifiers generally concur with the First Folio’s classification of the “problem plays,” with the exception that the SVM classifier identifies Troilus and Cressida as a comedy rather than a tragedy. The romances (Table <$n#table:romances>) are slightly more ambiguous. </p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Winter's Tale</p>
<p class="itemText">More strange is the classifiers’ identification of The Winter’s Tale as a history. The play earns its designation as a “romance” due to its two-part structure: it begins much like a tragedy, with Leontes at its centre. Halfway through, the character of “Time” comes on stage to declare that sixteen years have passed, and the play changes to a pastoral comedy which ultimately resolves all the looming tragedies of the beginning of the play. These two theatrical dynamics are visible in the social ne...</p>

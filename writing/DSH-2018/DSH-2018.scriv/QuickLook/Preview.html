<p class="itemTitle">opening</p>
<p class="itemText">There’s distant reading / “macroanalysis” (Jockers), which seeks to answer large questions of cultural history. And there’s something more akin to “close reading at a distance” or what Hoover terms “microanalysis,” which uses “style variation within a single work or author as a way of better understanding authorship and style” (Hoover DSH 2016). At both scales, a lot of work exists using stylometry to examine long prose works, with methods that are often thoughtfully adapted to address poetry as...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">TEI parser</p>
<p class="itemText">Examining network graphs requires, first, a substantial body of network graphs. Many scholars have handmade these graphs, either wholly by hand or as networks which can then be in Gephi. We developed a scalable method, which minimizes reduplication of effort by building upon prior scholarly work encoding other features of plays through the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standards. Our parser takes in a TEI-encoded play, extracts characters for the nodes of a network, and connects nodes via a dir...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">SVM & Naive Bayes</p>
<p class="itemText">We then used our generated network graphs to test our central question: whether the social network enacted by a play’s characters can be used as a proxy for features of the play’s narrative content. More specifically, we asked whether social networks can be used to distinguish between the dramatic genres of tragedy, comedy, and history.</p>
<p class="itemText">We decided that the answer would be “yes” if we could train a classifier to replicate the First Folio’s classifications for Shakespeare’s 36 plays. We tested 21 ...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">genres</p>
<p class="itemText">Comedies are, it turns out, the most straightforward networks to identify. They have fewer nodes, with high graph density. Although comedies often have multiple subplots, we find that these separate stories do not result in highly-separated networks. We theorize that comedic networks are strongly shaped by the final “resolution” scenes, which bring the cast together for a restoration of social order, and therefore create edges knitting the network together. (See, for example, A Midsummer Night’s...</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">macroanalysis</p>
<p class="itemText">Having verified that the network graphs do encode literary information, future work can apply these methods for macroanalysis. Our SVM trained on Shakespeare will only give meaningful results in an Early Modern context, but could nonetheless be straightforwardly applied to a larger Early Modern corpus. Algee-Hewitt has found, for example, [change in eigenvector]. This work suggests that he may be seeing, in part, a change in the popular genres.</p>

</ul>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">microanalysis</p>
<p class="itemText">We spent some time doing microanalysis. 36 plays is a small enough corpus that they can be scrutinized individually, and their network graphs visually examined. Much of the difficulty in identify genre in the first place stems from genre’s slippery status. Even in evaluating accuracy, we really determine the classifier’s ability to predict how the First Folio would have labelled a work, not the work’s “true” and objective genre. Shakespearean scholars by no means universally accept the First Fol...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">problem plays</p>
<p class="itemText">As Figure <$n#fig:problem-plays> shows, both classifiers generally concur with the First Folio’s classification of the “problem plays,” with the exception that the SVM classifier identifies Troilus and Cressida as a comedy rather than a tragedy. The romances (Figure <$n#fig:romances>) are slightly more ambiguous. </p>

<p class="itemTitle">Winter's Tale</p>
<p class="itemText">The Winter’s Tale provides a particularly useful case study for close-reading a play through the lens of its social network. The play earns its designation as a “romance” due to its two-part structure: the first X acts play like a tragedy, in which Leontes gradually ruins his own life. At the beginning of Act X, the character of “Time” comes on stage to declare that XX years have passed, and the play begins an extended pastoral comedy which ultimately resolves all the looming tragedies of the be...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">social networks rock</p>
<p class="itemText">The meaning of a theatrical social network can only be determined with reference to its theoretical context, but it can be done.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Our parser successfully and rapidly produces sophisticated social network graphs of TEI plays, which can be used to computationally identify theatrical genre in Shakespeare’s plays. Thirty-seven plays is a small scale for this approach: since the parser is highly extensible and can be used with any plays encoded in TEI, future work need not be restricted to the Early ...</p>

\f0\fs22 \cf0 The ability of the classifier to replicate the First Folio\'92s designations with substantially greater than random chance supports our initial hypothesis that the genre of a play is expressed in the relations it stages between its characters. The underlying details that drive the classification can also provide a new lens into the specific genres and character staging of of Shakespeare\'92s works, particularly in the case of plays which are resistant to this mode of classification. Beginning with the clearest results and moving into the realm of more ambiguous interpretation, we will discuss the implications of our classifications for the comedies; the histories and tragedies; and finally, the plays whose First Folio designations have been challenged.}

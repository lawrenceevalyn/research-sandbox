\f0\fs22 \cf0 We then use our generated network graphs to test our central question: whether the social network enacted by a play\'92s characters can be used as a proxy for features of the play\'92s narrative content. More specifically, we ask whether social networks can be used to distinguish between the dramatic genres of tragedy, comedy, and history.\
Using a support vector {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://4DE1D851-B794-41B8-AA1E-2A0E9045DA47"}}{\fldrslt machine}} with fivefold validation, we tested 17 different mathematical features of the networks. Even one feature could achieve classification accuracy substantially above random chance (66.43% accuracy examining only path length, and 61% examining only graph density, compared to 33% expected from random chance), with accuracy increasing as more features are considered in combination. We evaluated combinations of features up to 7 maximum. Our highest accuracy (88.93%) classified the plays by considering their Words, Lines, Closeness, Graph Density and Average Weighted Degree. This is a combination of play features (words, lines), node features (closeness), and network features (density and degree).}

\f0\fs22 \cf0 Tragedies are more formally unpredictable, and sit somewhere ambiguously between comedies and histories. Many have a dense core with a secondary ring of more peripheral characters. Many have a node who forms a distinct, singular centre of the network, connected to a large number of nodes that are only sparsely connected to each other. Directional edges are, as in histories, often unreciprocated, and the \'93tragic hero\'94 nodes are particularly likely to have very heavily weighted edges connecting outward (indicating that they have given long speeches) with light to no reciprocation.}

\f0\fs22 \cf0 Examining network graphs requires, first, a substantial body of network graphs. Many scholars have handmade these graphs, either wholly by hand or as networks which can then be in Gephi. We developed a scalable method, which minimizes reduplication of effort by building upon prior scholarly work encoding other features of plays through the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standards. Our parser takes in a TEI-encoded play, extracts characters for the nodes of a network, and connects nodes via a directional edge each time a character speaks while another character is on stage as a potential auditor{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://74041CFF-E8BD-4AB2-BBD7-A8630841ADB9"}}{\fldrslt .}} We began by replicating Moretti\'92s results in order to verify our parser\'92s accuracy{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://5DFDEA89-36DF-4EAF-89FE-22C3AFF8823A"}}{\fldrslt ,}} then generated networks for a full corpus of Shakespeare\'92s {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://EF81EF5C-74D4-443B-991C-5C5495785C3A"}}{\fldrslt works.}}}

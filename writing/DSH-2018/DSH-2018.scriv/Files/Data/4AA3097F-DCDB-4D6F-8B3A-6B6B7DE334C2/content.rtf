\f0\fs22 \cf0 Examining network graphs requires, first, a substantial body of network graphs. Many scholars have handmade theatrical network graphs, both as wholly artistic interpretations (Moretti) and as mathematically-expressed networks (Trilcke et al., Fischer et al.). Like the Digital Literary Network Analysis (dlina) working group, we acquire our networks by parsing plays which have been encoded according to the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standards. Our parser takes in a TEI-encoded play, extracts characters for the nodes of a network, and connects nodes via a directional edge each time a character speaks while another character is on stage as a potential auditor{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://74041CFF-E8BD-4AB2-BBD7-A8630841ADB9"}}{\fldrslt .}} By using directional edges, weighting character connections based on speech, and by sub-dividing the play into blocks smaller than the unit of the scene based on the configurations of characters present on stage, we create networks at a higher level of detail than prior work which creates edges simply for co-occurrence within a scene. We began by replicating Moretti\'92s results in order to verify our parser\'92s accuracy{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://5DFDEA89-36DF-4EAF-89FE-22C3AFF8823A"}}{\fldrslt ,}} then generated networks for a full corpus of Shakespeare\'92s {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://EF81EF5C-74D4-443B-991C-5C5495785C3A"}}{\fldrslt works.}}}

\f0\fs22 \cf0 Much of the difficulty in identify genre in the first place stems from genre\'92s slippery status. Even in evaluating accuracy, we really determine the classifier\'92s ability to predict how the First Folio would have labelled a work, not the work\'92s \'93true\'94 and objective genre. Shakespearean scholars by no means universally accept the First Folio\'92s assignments. Accordingly, once we had trained our SVM, we queried two sets of ambiguous texts, the \'93problem plays\'94 and the \'93romances,\'94 to see what social network analysis might offer these debates.}

\f0\fs22 \cf0 We treat none of our classifications as definitive declaration of the plays\'92 \'93real\'94 genres, but network analysis gives us a new way to think about their genres. Thirty-six plays is a small scale for this approach: since the parser is highly extensible and can be used with any plays encoded in TEI, future work need not be restricted to the Early Modern period. It need not even be restricted to works written in English. The purpose of these tools is to confirm some ways that we have thought about these texts, but also to reconsider them and to open up new vocabulary for the problem cases. Genre, we argue, plays out in who people stand on a stage with, and who they talk to and listen to. Our networks of the well-studied works of Shakespeare can provide a baseline against which to contextualize genre analysis of works for which there is far less critical conversation.}

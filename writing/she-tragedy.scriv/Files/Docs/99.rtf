 [This paper will draw upon excellent work that sees the play\'92s systems in terms of economic exchange, in terms of gendered social hierarchies, in terms of sexual desire], [all of which certainly operate in the play]. [However, my central idiom will be that of the speech act] [These other systems of power manifest themselves in restrictions on who can speak to whom, and of what] [As J. L. Austin\'92s \'93How To Do Things With Words\'94 ultimately concludes, all speech is in some way performative, an attempt to act upon the world] [Thus one of the characteristic acts of the play is to demand that another character speak] [Agency is about being able to act upon the world around you.] [Particularly at issue in this play, which is so attuned to Jaffeir\'92s personal allegiances, is the ability to act upon a social world]}

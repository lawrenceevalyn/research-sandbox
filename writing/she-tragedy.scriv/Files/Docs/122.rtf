\f0\fs24 \cf0 Within the fictive world of the play, the character\'92s various asides and soliloquies are addressed to no one. But in the theatre in which the play is staged, they represent a character\'92s most direct address to the audience itself. An alternative way to model the play, then, is to include the audience as a character embedded within the network, as in Figure 9. The fictional social connections have been grayed out in order to render more visible the connections between character and audience, rendered in blue. The overall shape of the network doesn\'92t change dramatically with this inclusion, but this figure does reveal an imbalance in who gets to address the audience: Belvidera, Priuli, \'93Senators,\'94 and Antonio all represent the senate at great length, and only Renault speaks for the conspirators. Jaffeir and Aquilina, their allegiances mixed, also address the audience. Pierre, despite his outsized influence within the world of the play, is mute along this axis. Perhaps this is why Gruber is able to sdebate \'93Pierre's status as villain\'94 (163): although he speaks at great length in the play, none of his appeals are made to the audience, potentially excluding us from identification with his principles and motivations.}

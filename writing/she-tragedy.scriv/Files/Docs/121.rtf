\f0\fs24 \cf0 Of our three central characters, Belvidera only interacts on stage with Jaffeir; despite her role as a mediator between the conspiracy and the senate, she does not create social connections between the two groups, but instead mediates her relationships between her father or her husband. These constraints are classically patriarchal; David Hughes argues, via Eve Kosofsky-Sedgwick\'92s work, that

\i0  \'93[uses] women as currency in the maintenance of male relationships\'94 (378), and Belvidera\'92s role as an object of exchange is certainly apparent in the mercenary vocabulary he highlights. But it is also apparent in the conversational dynamics when she is on stage, and particularly in the scene discussed above where she is given over to Renault. Most of the conspirators leave the stage before she is brought out, and once she arrives, as noted above, she speaks to no one but Jaffeir until she cannot avoid doing otherwise. Belvidera and Pierre actually share the stage at this point, for a significant stretch of time, but neither verbally acknowledges the other. In this way, despite having the potential to create a wide range of social connections, out of decorum she is shielded from all but the fatal Renault, while Jaffeir strengthens his own social bonds through her. Belvidera\'92s method of bridging groups is thus functionally opposite to the Duke\'92s: rather than speaking to and between both sides, others speak to each other about her.}

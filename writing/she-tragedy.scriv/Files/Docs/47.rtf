\f0\fs24 \cf0 [This simple binary is challenged by the full force of the play as it actually exists]. [With Aquilina restored to the play], [even the division of the plot into a conflict between two sides is lost]. [Instead, all is confusion.] [She connects Antonio and Pierre, compromising both.]\
[In excising the \'93Nicky-Nacky\'94 scenes, then, [the censors] also made the play more politically straightforward.] [The contrast reveals that the original is [dangerously?] ambiguous], [with both sides deeply compromised]. [Earlier criticism has discussed this political ambiguity in terms of the sexual corruption on both sides], [and the non-specificity of the conspirators\'92 claims]; I argue that it also plays out as a difficulty in dividing them up into two social groups. [??? Do I? A bold claim!]}

To investigate the stability of the social network, the publication history of 
\i Venice Preserv\'92d
\i0  happens to provide us with a ready-made experiment: later stagings and printings of the play often excised the \'93Nicky-Nacky\'94 scenes, which also had the effect of removing Aquilina from the social network of the play. Figure 9 shows the structure of an 1847 American edition of the play, \'93correctly given, as performed at the Theatres Royal,\'94 which not only cuts the offending scenes, but also shortens many lines and conversations throughout the play. These alterations are worthy of close-reading in their content: many of Belvidera\'92s lines, for example, appear to have been censored for {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://DBD636B4-0329-4E79-9411-23E57C114972"}}{\fldrslt sensuality}},  an editorial decision that supports those critical readings which see Belvidera as defined by her sexual desire. At the scale of the plot, these changes draw our attention to different elements of the play. Munns\'92 introduction to the Broadview text suggests that the Nicky-Nacky scenes were cut for being \'93pointless\'94 in addiction to obscene (381), but the shape of the play\'92s social network changes remarkably without them: now we see something a bit less muddled, where Jaffeir, in the centre, is torn between his ties to Pierre and to Belvidera, each of whom brings connections to a largely-distinct social world. Without Aquilina, it is much easier to frame the play in terms of the \'93\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 stable series of binary oppositions\'94 that Marsden sees as defining she-tragedy (63).}

\f0\fs24 \cf0 Belvidera, as she dies, seems to blame [Jaffeir and Pierre], [men and conspirators]. [Priuli, in blaming his own curelty, seems to agree: if he had maintained Belvidera under his own protection, she would have been safe.] \
[But whereas Priuli takes for granted that there are \'91right\'92 men to guard Belvidera, Rogers and Gruber blame masculinity in itself.] [It\'92s fun to quote them together because they disagree so strongly on other points, but although they disagree on Belvidera\'92s role within the patriarchy, they both agree that it\'92s a patriarchy].}

\f0\fs22 \cf0 This still seems like a thought experiment: how does this then contribute to a larger intellectual project \'97 choice, surprise, diversity of thought; start with that, and then just say it\'92s happening in a particular area, then show how I will write about that bigger claim. They won\'92t believe me if I say I\'92ll do this to a social media site \'97 say I\'92m doing it on literature, and use that to write about what is happening in Twitter etc to describe how we could do it different. Everybody already writes about how it\'92s fucked \'97 I can map a better path. Program of publications that is both public humanities and scholarly. Write for Time or Wired or something making the same point. Not proposing a monograph at all \'97 a project that has a tool and a program of thought; probably stronger than the first suggestion. Maybe invent some kind of eventual monograph\'85?}

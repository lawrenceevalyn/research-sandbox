\f0\fs24 \cf0 To achieve a low number of degrees of separation, a character needs to speak to a large percentae of the characters in the play. To achieve the 
\i lowest
\i0  number, that character must speak to people outside their own social circle. Among the conspirators, for example, Brabe, Branveil, Durhand, Mezzana, Restrosi, Revillido, Ternon, and Theodore all have the identical average degrees of separaton of 1.93. This number is high because they don\'92t, for the most part, speak to each other \'97 they speak as a group to Bedamar, the Duke, Elliott, Jaffeir, Pierre, Renault, and Spinosa, and are then connected back to each other through those connections. Spinosa and Elliott, who both have an average of 1.68 degrees of separation from the characters of the play, have a lower number because they do connect directly to this mass of conspirators. But they are nonetheless tied because, as long as both remain only within their circle, neither can lower his number relative to the other. Renault rises in the ranks by virtue of his connection to Belvidera, which also brings him one degree closer to her \'93Servants\'94. Pierre surpasses him \'97 despite having no direct connection to Belvidera \'97 by adding connections to Antonio, Aquilina (who shortens his distance to her \'93Maid\'94), the \'93Father\'94, the \'93Officer\'94, Priuli (who shortens his distance to Belvidera\'92s \'93Maid 2\'94), and the \'93Senators\'94. These details are about the math behind Figure 5, but they are also about the social boundaries of the play, and the role of clustering in identifying social groups.}

\f0\fs24 \cf0 To rephrase in positive terms: because Aquilina is present, the play\'92s social world is one interconnected unit. Aquilina\'92s role as a \'91public woman\'92 means that she circulates between men who otherwise have nothing in common, and it is her public reputation that spares from the consequences of harboring conspirators, when she is known and recognized by the Duke and even by the nameless \'93Senator\'94 after Antonio\'92s speech on her behalf. Aquilina\'92s centrality to the cohesion of the play accords with Laura Rosenthal\'92s argument that the figure of the prostitute had become central to \'97 though also indicative to problems with \'97 the modern social order as it was understood. Because she underpins the play\'92s structure, both the senate and the conspirators are implicated in the free-floating sexual and financial corruption. Any social ills which the play might criticize, then, aren\'92t isolated to one part of the network \'97 impeding attempts to draw clear boundaries around the targests of that criticism.}

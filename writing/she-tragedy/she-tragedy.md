The Heroine of Eighteenth Century She-Tragedy, in Her Network
(revise to include the word “graph” if I am accepted?)
The gendered role of the actress on stage, from the seventeenth century through the eighteenth, is often discussed in terms of the spectacle of the female body. In contrast, I turn my attention to the role of speech. In the eighteenth-century fad for “she-tragedy,” a heroine could have an overwhelming impact on theatregoers — but often very little impact on her fellow characters. This paper uses computational social network analysis of fifty plays 1670–1770 to abstract and compare heroines’ positions within the social worlds of their plays. Each social network models the number, length, and direction of each character’s lines in the play, building a map of characters’ relationships as reflected in their speech acts. Handmade networks of Thomas Otway’s Venice Preserv’d (1682) and Arthur Murphy’s The Grecian Daughter (1772) show a strong contrast between Belvidera’s extremely limited social sphere in Venice Preserv’d, and Euphrasia’s social centrality and plot agency in The Grecian Daughter. What both heroines have in common, however, is a particular use of asides and soliloquies. When the audience is modelled as the target of these speeches, and therefore represented as a node in the social network of the play, the true importance of the heroine becomes visible. Computationally-generated networks of selected plays from the century of theatrical development between Venice Preserv’d and The Grecian Daughter contextualize the differences between Belvidera and Euphrasia as social agents on- and off-stage. Taking up the interrelated histories of the heroic drama, the pathetic tragedy, and the bourgeois drama, this paper articulates a definition of the she-tragedy based on how and to whom the heroine is able to speak.


Although she-tragedy heroines are marginalized in the world of their plays, they make direct claims on the audience’s sympathy. They are distinct from the heroes of heroic drama before and the bourgeois drama after in their ability to speak directly out from the stage.
when theatrical tastes shift away from pathetic tragedy and toward bourgeois drama, this doesn’t look like a change in women’s status on the stage, but it actually is, because they get more agency.
Social network graphs let us see whether she-tragedy heroines are socially marginalized, seperately from the question of their agency within the plot of the play

All plays with the string “traged*” somewhere in their description, 1650-1800.

(If my starter list of she-tragedies don’t all get found via this method, I will rethink it.)

How will I make sure I get French and German plays too?

# wikipedia on she-tragedy #

When English drama was reborn in 1660 with the re-opening of the theatres, the leading tragic style was the male-dominated heroic dramawhich celebrated powerful, aggressively masculine heroes and their pursuit of glory, as rulers and conquerors as well as lovers. In the 1670s and 1680s, a gradual shift occurred from heroic to pathetic tragedy, where the subject was love and domestic concerns, even though the main characters might be public figures. After the phenomenal success of Elizabeth Barry in moving the audience to tears in the role of Monimia in Otway's The Orphan, she-tragedy became the dominant form of pathetic tragedy and remained highly popular for nearly half a century.


She tragedies are known for having focused on the hardships of women rather than those suffered by men. A she-tragedy during the 1680s derived its power from the ability to create titillating scenes that portrayed the suffering of an innocent woman.[4] Pathetic tragedies would begin by presenting the heroine and establishing that she was desirable. Unlike the other popular new genre, horror, the she-tragedy did not depend on violence and gore to become the spectacle of the heroine but rather used the physical suffering that was inflicted on the blameless female victims.[5] The women, who were the subject of the play, would usually become victims of adversity and crimes that sexually exploited them such as rape or unsolicited adultery. During the scenes of rape the woman would be abducted and carried off stage. The act of rape, or adultery, would be conveyed to the audience by screams from the woman as the villain completed the evil deed. After the scene the woman would return onstage. Evidences of ravished womanhood such as disheveled hair, disordered clothing, and phallic dagger were trademark of Restoration rape and prominent in she-tragedy.[6] Playwrights would utilize other ill fortune such as the loss of a husband or child and a single mother's struggle to raise her children as another means of causing hardship in the heroine's life. After suffering these hardships throughout the play the female protagonist would be overcome by madness, commit suicide or murder as a result of the burden with which she had suffered.[7] The success of a she-tragedy was dependent upon the emotion that the actress conveyed to the audience, but the emotion that the audience felt as they watched the performance. She-tragedy also focused on making the heroine and not the hero the focus of the play. Attention would be placed on the female actress and her sexuality as playwrights used specific dialogue and devices to focus on the sexuality of the woman. One example of this is seen in The Orphan by Otway. In a scene Monimia is accompanied by a page who states to her "Madam, Indeed I'd serve you with my soul; But n the morning when you call me to you As by your bed I stand and tell you stories, I am asham'd to see your swelling Breasts, It makes me blush, they are so very white." (1.221-25) Here Otway is directing the audience's eyes to the actress' breasts, making her the focal point, and also sexualizing the actress and the character of Monima.[8]

## french and german too ##

Because my method is interested only in who speaks to whom, and relies only on TEI, I can easily consider French and German plays without being able to read them!

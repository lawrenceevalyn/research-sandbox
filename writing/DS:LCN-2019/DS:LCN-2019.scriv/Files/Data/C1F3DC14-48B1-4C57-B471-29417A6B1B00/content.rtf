\f0\fs22 \cf0 We then used our generated network graphs to test our central question: whether character speech interaction can be used to distinguish between the dramatic genres of tragedy, comedy, and history. We decided that the answer would be \'93yes\'94 if we could train a classifier to replicate the First Folio\'92s classifications for Shakespeare\'92s 36 plays. We tested three classifier {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://E4915F75-6300-40D2-9635-8F1144ADBD2A"}}{\fldrslt algorithms}} with fivefold cross-validation, using 21 different mathematical features as the metrics for {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://42D03077-8600-4DAC-A9FA-B50E68A4E222"}}{\fldrslt comparison.}} We found that even one feature could achieve classification {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://1BA59384-DD23-4CE1-9224-D2F36E4D6503"}}{\fldrslt accuracy}} substantially above random chance. Since there are three possibilities, a random guess would be correct 33% of the time, but we achieved 66.43% accuracy using only the networks\'92 average path {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://5E207895-2831-4FE2-AED7-027FBF96B3C2"}}{\fldrslt length}}. Accuracy increases as more features are considered in combination. With two features, our maximum accuracy is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://904F4735-A900-4A9E-AE51-C646808341D3"}}{\fldrslt 77.86%.}} With three features, we reach 83.57%{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://C8EEEAE1-891C-4204-81C8-32BD89AFBD67"}}{\fldrslt .}} We evaluated combinations of features up to 7 maximum.}

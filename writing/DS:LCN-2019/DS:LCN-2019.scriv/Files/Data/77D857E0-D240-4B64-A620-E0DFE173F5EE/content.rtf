\f0\fs22 \cf0 There has been a lot of scholarship on digital methods (network or otherwise) to borrow for Shakespeare studies. Leaning on Jockers and Hoover feels a bit lazy when there are better options (Mike Witmore & Jonathan Hope\'92s SHX Quarterly article leaps to mind on genre and style; the authorship attribution studies often deal with genre as a variable; Ruth and Sebastian Ahnert\'92s work on the State Papers online explores the viability of network analysis for visualizing connections between individuals; Anupam Basu has done some work on constructing networks for Shx plays, etc).}

As our discussion of the tragedies suggests, genre is never simple. Even in evaluating accuracy, we really determine the classifier\'92s ability to predict how the First Folio would have labelled a work, not the work\'92s \'93true\'94 and objective genre. Shakespearean scholars by no means universally accept the First Folio\'92s assignments. Accordingly, once we had trained our SVM classifier, we queried three sets of ambiguous texts \'97 what are now called the \'93Roman plays,\'94 the \'93problem plays,\'94 and the \'93romances\'94 \'97 to see what social network analysis might offer these debates. The way we see genre now might not be the way Shakespeare\'92s Early Modern audiences understood it; by defining each play only in reference to Shakespeare\'92s other works, we open a possibility to see them differently.}

<p class="itemTitle">opening: the mass of Radcliffean imitators</p>
<p class="itemText">The Gothic novel in the 1790s comes with its own conventional narrative. Ann Radcliffe, the “Great Enchantress,” enthrals audiences for a decade with literary blockbusters which are gobbled up by women who scribble their own novels in response. The marketplace is glutted with these unskilled copies of Radcliffe, written by authoresses eager for Radcliffe’s fame or her financial security, trying to replicate Radcliffe’s formula. The popularity of this “school of Radcliffe” is both its threat and ...</p>

<p class="itemText">[It is necessary for new knowledge to be built upon the foundations of former knowledge; but equally it is necessary to re-investigate the truth of what is “known.”] This project revives two qualitative bibliographies from the 1980s to seek gendered patterns of writing among hundreds of early Gothic texts. I am particularly interested in trends that could have predictive power: rather than speculating about a book’s meaning based on its author’s gender, I set out to ask whether, in fast, there i...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">history of the Female Gothic</p>
<p class="itemText">[The thing in past literary criticism that I wish to subject to scrutiny is the category of the Female Gothic.] The “obviously” female-associated phenomenon [of the previously mentioned conventional narrative] led to the critical category of the “Female Gothic” to discuss narratives of women in patriarchal distress. Ellen Ledoux lists off the standard requirements — “a distressed heroine, domestic incarceration, threats of sexual violence, anxiety about monstrous or absent mothers” (2) / “women’...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Male Gothic less often / well defined</p>
<p class="itemText">The continuing use of [Female / women’s Gothic] stands in a striking contrast to the dearth of work on the Male Gothic. Even in a context in which men are assumed to be famously outnumbered, [the status of “male” as “default” means] their works are “unmarked” or assumed to be defined by things other than gender. The Female Gothic is often treated as synonymous with the explained supernatural, or the ‘terror’ mode in the terror/horror distinction, but no terminology is used for the ‘unexplained s...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Ledoux: Female Gothic isn't real</p>
<p class="itemText">From this literary history, Ledoux concludes that “the category “Female Gothic” more accurately reflects the ideological goals of second-wave feminist literary criticism than it represents the narratives of early women Gothic writers” (2) Despite many scholars’ work showing that “women’s early Gothic writing— a great deal of which is only accessible to us because of the recovery work of feminist scholars—is much more aesthetically, politically, thematically, and generically diverse than the Fema...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Men are weird, not women</p>
<p class="itemText">I began by asking whether [I could actually tell men and women’s books apart]. [This approach asks about men’s and women’s gothics, rather than male and female gothics. It does not assume that either actually exists.] Based on my findings, I suggest that our attention to gender has been exactly the opposite of what is supported by the variety of texts produced under the Gothic umbrella. Although there are many Gothic features which are strongly predictive of male authorship, I find nothing that ...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">I'm modelling here</p>
<p class="itemText">Johanna Drucker has given compelling warnings about the dangers of treating constructed information as empirically objective “data” which may then be passively “visualized”. Willard McCarty’s discussion of models as both “pragmatic” and “fictive” is more accurate to the scholarly process of gathering, classifying, correlating, and interpreting information. Whether a model is a reading or a bar chart, the worth of that model must be judged by its “fruitfulness”, a term for which Stephen Ramsay pr...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">theory: my bibs have thin description</p>
<p class="itemText">My theoretical approach emphasizes the continuities between computational approaches to literature and the the venerable tradition of archival bibliographical research. Heather Love has notably turned to sociological microanalysis as a model for 'thin description' close-but-not-deep reading methods; I employ qualitative computational modelling as another method which seeks the same goals. Love emphasizes thin description as not just “fine-grained” but “exhaustive” (and possibly exhausting) but w...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Frank and Tracy are models</p>
<p class="itemText">My two ‘texts’ — bibliographies by Ann Tracy and Frederick Frank — are thus themselves models of “The Gothic Novel.” Because, as Price observes, the process of editing a text must always reveal the editor’s “unspoken assumptions about the most efficient way to convey information, and indeed what counts as information at all,” the editorial processes behind each bibliography makes each one sensitive to very different concerns. Ann Tracy’s The Gothic Novel 1790-1830: Plot Summaries and Index to Mo...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">key findings up front</p>
<p class="itemText">Over the course of three literary experiments, in which I model the early Gothic novel by means of bibliographic data, I ask whether the hundreds of women writing Gothic novels wrote observably different books than the hundreds of men doing the same. This project ultimately reinforces Ledoux’s argument that the Female Gothic is a retroactive critical creation. Frederick Frank’s critical categories paint a picture of Radcliffe as the centre of a group of female, sentimental copiers. But Ann Tracy...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">my model of Frank</p>
<p class="itemText">Adapting Frank’s model for my own, then, required working somewhat against the grain of his assumptions. However, I have avoided simply assigning each text one simple genre. Instead, I have separated out each strand of influence within his complex “Gothic types”  by dividing each “type” into a set of tags, and tallied the uses of each tag. This process generated 190 unique tags, most of which only apply to one or two works. By rendering the tags individually listable, my model imposes a more sys...</p>

<p class="itemText">For the most part, however, Frank’s bibliography resists division into a gendered binary. As Figure <$n#figs:popularFranks> shows, the two most prevalent tags in the corpus as a whole are “Gothic” (83% of all works) and “pure/high” (39%), both of which have the same gendered distribution of the sample as a whole.

Twelve works are identified as “proto” or “early” forms of something else; of those 12, 7 are by men (58%). This evocative detail could either suggest that the Gothic’s roots are more masculine than its popular flourishing, or that critical attention is more likely to credit male authors with originating important literary forms.

<p class="itemText">Tracy’s bibliography is built to be more like a particularly helpful finding aid than a comprehensive check-list.  Her most unusual qualitative bibliographical work is her ten-page “Index to Motifs” identifying the books in which 208 different “motifs” appear. Tracy uses the term “motif” broadly to encompass a wide range of plot elements, images, and character types. The index is intended for “scholars with particular interests”, who...</p>

Using her model to investigate the possibility of a women’s Gothic, I examine the potential predictive power of each motif. I ask whether the presence of any given motif in a work constitutes meaningful information regarding the probable gender of that work’s author.

<p class="itemTitle">men's Gothic</p>
<p class="itemText">Comparing these male-dominated motifs to the neutral or female-dominated motifs involves constant escalation. Women may write about libertines (64% female), whose seductions may be coercive and almost always end poorly for their victims, but men write about the act of rape itself (75% male). Tracy’s motifs suggest that the darkest side of the Gothic was primarily the province of men: death is female-dominated when it is sad or pious (61% female), but murder is male-dominated (64% male), as are b...</p>

At the top of the list of “horror” motifs is “Inquisition” — 63% of “horror” Gothics include the Inquisition, an enormous increase over the baseline 15% presence of that motif.

Four are even perfect ties: elopement (all subcategories); duelling and other single combat; fainting, female; and rediscovery of lost relatives.

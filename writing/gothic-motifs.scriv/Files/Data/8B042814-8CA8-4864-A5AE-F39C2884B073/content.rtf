\f0\fs22 \cf0 More strikingly male-dominated are two characteristics \cf2 [which come down almost entirely to personal assessment]\cf0 : \'93\cf2 prototypical\cf0 \'94 and \'93polemical\'94 works. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://48675305-CE8E-47FA-9F68-39F52C2AC7B2"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Twelve}} works are identified as \'93proto\'94 or \'93early\'94 forms of something else; of those 12, 7 are by men (58%). \cf2 This evocative detail could either suggest that the Gothic\'92s roots are more masculine than its popular flourishing, or that critical attention is more likely to credit male authors with originating important literary forms. \cf0 A slightly larger group of works exists with the tags \'93polemical,\'94 \'93philosophical,\'94 \'93political,\'94 and \'93radical/revolutionary\'94 \'97 of these 19, 13 are by men (68%).\cf2 \
\cf0 The highest male percentage that applies to more than one work is for \'93polemical\'94 Gothics, which fiercely flog some viewpoint or another: 83% of the six \'93polemical\'94 works are by men. The \cf2 male\cf0  \cf2 correlation with\cf0  \'93polemical\'94 works is particularly suggestive in light of the numbers for \'93didactic\'94 works, which are entirely {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://B12756B6-258F-4563-80D0-AF44ACABAC62"}}{\fldrslt neutral (50% each)}}. \'93Didactic\'94 works are the only works with a persuasive agenda in which men do not dominate, suggesting a qualitative distinction: men can produce confrontational political works, whereas the didactic is a more equal-opportunity field in which women, too, can promote their ideas under the aegis of instruction.\cf2  [OR, women\'92s opinions are treated as nurturing/\'93teaching\'94 \'85 This one could genuinely be either 18thC social pressures or 20thC interpretive bias.]}

\f0\fs20 \cf0 The consensus then and since, that most circulating libraries stocked novels that were formula escapist \'91trash\'92 largely by women and for women and servants, is being modified by new quantitative and qualitative research. \'85 Though women outnumbered its men authors there were many of the latter, there were about as many novels with male as female protagonists, and many novels show sophisticated awareness of gender stereotypes. (\'93The Popular Novel, 1790-1820) \
\'93The eighteenth (p. 428) century did see an enlarging role for women as readers and writers of fiction, but gender alone cannot account for the change of direction: works by male authors, such as Goldsmith\'92s The Vicar of Wakefield, Sterne\'92s A Sentimental Journey, Mackenzie\'92s The Man of Feeling, and Smollett\'92s The Expedition of Humphry Clinker were popular with readers of both sexes.\'94 (\'93Developments in Sentimental Fiction\'94)\

\'93Yet the arguments that, first, only women read novels at all, and yet, secondly, that only bad women read novels whereas good women read good works\'97particularly sermons and conduct manuals\'97were manifestly untrue. \'85 By the late eighteenth century, however, more women than ever before were writing novels, and recent research has shown that they produced about a third of those published.9 From 1770 to 1800, novels identified as female on their title pages crested, but so, indeed, did all novels\'85 In fact, most novel-readers were male, as most readers always had been. By the mid-eighteenth century, only about 60 per cent of men and 40 per cent of women could read at all, and, while works of religion, history, geography, and travel outstripped novels in most libraries, provincial novel-readers and library-borrowers were primarily male.24 In fact, men and women read largely the same books\'94 (\'91Male\'92 and \'91Female\'92 novels?)}

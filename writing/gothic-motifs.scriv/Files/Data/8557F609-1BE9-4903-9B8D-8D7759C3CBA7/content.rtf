\f0\fs30 \cf0 This correlation confirms a conclusion drawn from examining just Tracy\'92s motifs, that the men\'92s Gothic might operate via striking images but the women\'92s Gothic less so. Men\'92s horror is a minor tradition within the genre, easy to single out for censure but not the most widely-imitated. Men\'92s and women\'92s schools do indeed exist, but that they do not map neatly to a set of female/male terror/horror Radcliffe/Lewis binaries, and that both gendered schools are dwarfed by a largely non-gendered Gothic mainstream. These findings serve as a a useful reminder that not all contrasts are perfect binaries; the existence of a men\'92s Gothic tradition does not require that everything outside that tradition be a perfectly-opposed women\'92s Gothic. They also suggest that, when we are seduced by the scenery of the Gothic, we end up paying attention to only a minor thread within it \'97 men\'92s horror Gothics \'97 at the expense of less-graspable but equally-crucial features which better define the mainstream.}

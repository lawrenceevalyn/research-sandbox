The more-popular terror mode is non-gendered (X% female, X% male), while the horror mode tends toward male authorship (X% male). However, of those X novels tagged as horror, X were also tagged as terror, leaving a mere X books are pure \'93horror mode.\'94 If we attempt to treat the two modes as mutually-exclusive, seaparating out the \'93horror-terror\'94 mixed-mode books as a third mode, our gendered expectations fall apart: the X pure-horror books are precisely split between male and female authors. Instead, it is the horror-terror mode which is most predictive of male authorship (X% male). [It seems, then, that although the relative prominence of the two modes accords with our expectations based on Tracy\'92s, the critical identification of terror and horror does not have a basis in gendered patterns of use. ???]}

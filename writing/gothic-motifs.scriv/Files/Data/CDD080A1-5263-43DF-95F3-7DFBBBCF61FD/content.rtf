\f0\i\fs22 \cf0 Contemporary criticism has worked to revise the eighteenth-century consensus that the literary sphere was overtaken with a flood of dangerous sentimental literature by and for women: Barbara Benedict, for example, ruthlessly debunks a range of \'93manifestly untrue\'94 eighteenth-century perceptions of reading demographics{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://519FEBDA-49CD-4104-AD49-E06D0753CEA2"}}{\fldrslt ,}} and many others have agreed that most readers and most writers were men, and even that men and women mostly read the same things. However, the preponderance of women writing Frank\'92s sentimental works suggests a kernel of truth underlying eighteenth-century critics\'92 panic. It is entirely possible for readers to be mostly male, and authors mostly male, even within the sphere of specifically Gothic publishing, but for female authors to nonetheless write a detectably feminine kind of book.}

"this is about genre, and how SN can help us think about genre. genre is hard. I'm gonna do it to Shakespeare, and the First Folio, for which there is a ton of genre studies [cite a whole bunch of shakespeare handbooks' intros on the three genres]"

SNA is anachronistic
what we're actually tracking, extremely precisely, is when characters talk to each other on stage -- linguistic encounters in the space of the stage -- not the same thing as a social network
never use the word society -- don't go as far as Stiller
"social encounter" is a less anachronistic

weed out the generalizations about "drama" because they don't fully apply
what I'm talking about is how a script is a different kind of text than prose
restrict myself to Early Modern drama
drama, theatre, and performance are distinctly different -- I'm talking about drama, things written for performance, not theatre or performance

tragedies look really close to histories to Alex
which makes sense for how tragedy emerges generically
findings are even larger than I think? genre has something to do with relations between characters (not something that people have necessarily said); the idea that comedy is about social connection is not new, but that it can be mapped by the way characters relate on the stage is different and interesting. 

Roman plays are the point at which we transition from history to tragedy

interesting to think about the fact that the thing that makes the Tempest so different from the other comedies is Prospero, and the way that everything 


* increase the number of diagrams
* acknowledge more of the problems, be less sure (esp re: histories)
-- when we say that the comedies are easy, make it clear that it's run on the full corpus etc, that errors come in through the histories/tragedy distinction

conclusion: this is a new way of thinking about the plays

new ordering? "comedies are really simple. ok, and now let's look at what this does when things get complicated." (or at least signpost then that we're gonna come back to the problem/romance plays) -- our way of reading is that tragedies are the least clear: it might look like they're similar to tragedies (explain math), but there's something else with density (more math), and what's really interesting is the way it makes us look at the place

come in to the conclusions -- say the point of these tools is to confirm some ways to think about the text, but also to reconsider them and give us new tools to think about the problem cases (and then go onto the rough of what we're doing)

summary: beginning needs to revise language to make it precise that I'm about scripts; emphasize that we're gonna talk about genre, we're working in the tradition that examines First Folio designations; methods is fine, maybe add more explaining classifiers in the footnote; comedies, yay (but this will get complicated later); histories, then tragedies, these look a bit the same but math makes distinction; here's my muddle; conclusion, here's a new way of looking at old questions (though not new findings), with the one sentence that genre plays out in where people stand on a stage and who they talk to and listen to -- which was our testable hypothesis: does it actually matter to a play, people standing on a stage talking in the presence of each other?





Jess: wanted, at the beginning, to have a strong sense of how the immediate hypothesis related to long term goals
literally say at the beginning "before I can ask questions about the changing role of the heroine in the 18thC (does it matter when a woman stands on stage and people don't listen to her?) I had to prove that it mattered who was on stage and who they talked to. So we started with Shakespeare.

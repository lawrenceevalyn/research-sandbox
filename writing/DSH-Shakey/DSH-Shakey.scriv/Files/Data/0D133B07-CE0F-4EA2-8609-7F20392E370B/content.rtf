\f0\fs22 \cf0 Our mode of abstraction is the network: we model each individual play as a web of speech passing between characters who share a stage. Ours is not the first project to apply social network analysis to literary study{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://6EB1F712-17C9-4169-BB9A-69B0847C94AC"}}{\fldrslt .}} Where we differ from much past work is in our precise focus on linguistic encounters in the space of the stage, rather than rougher metrics like appearance within the same scene. To draw the edges between nodes that make up our networks, we pay close attention to who is on stage, and who can (probably) hear them {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://0CFE9AEF-7C5F-44FB-9182-1FC957B53741"}}{\fldrslt speak}} \'97 and how often they speak, how much they speak at once, and whether people speak back to them. Our model of each play thus renders the speech act of the characters as a fundamental \'93unit\'94 of a play\'92s script, and our core hypothesis is thus that genre, in drama, will be expressed in the relations between characters.}

<p class="itemTitle">introduction</p>
<p class="itemText">Genre, as one of the eternally difficult questions of literary study, is a ubiquitous subject for computational “distant reading” of literature. In setting out many of the “perennial doubts [that] plague genre theory,” Daniel Chandler notes as one source of difficulty that “[p]articular features which are characteristic of a genre are not normally unique to it; it is their relative prominence, combination and functions which are distinctive” (1977). Often, the relative prominence of these distin...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">plays as networks</p>
<p class="itemText">Our mode of abstraction is the network: we model each individual play as a web of speech passing between characters who share a stage. Ours is not the first project to apply social network analysis to literary study. Where we differ from much past work is in our precise focus on linguistic encounters in the space of the stage, rather than rougher metrics like appearance within the same scene. To draw the edges between nodes that make up our networks, we pay close attention to who is on stage, an...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">TEI parser</p>
<p class="itemText">Examining network graphs requires, first, a substantial body of network graphs. Many scholars have handmade theatrical network graphs, both as wholly artistic interpretations (Moretti, 2011) and as mathematically-expressed networks (Trilcke et al., 2016; Fischer et al., 2017; Algee-Hewitt, 2017). Like the Digital Literary Network Analysis (dlina) working group (Fischer et al., 2018), we acquire our networks by parsing plays which have been encoded according to the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">classifiers</p>
<p class="itemText">We then used our generated network graphs to test our central question: whether character speech interaction can be used to distinguish between the dramatic genres of tragedy, comedy, and history. We decided that the answer would be “yes” if we could train a classifier to replicate the First Folio’s classifications for Shakespeare’s 36 plays. We tested three classifier algorithms with fivefold cross-validation, using 21 different mathematical features as the metrics for comparison. We found that...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">genres</p>
<p class="itemText">The ability of the classifier to replicate the First Folio’s designations with substantially greater than random chance supports our initial hypothesis that the genre of a play is expressed in the relations it stages between its characters. The underlying details that drive the classification can also provide a new lens into the specific genres and character staging of of Shakespeare’s works, particularly in the case of plays which are resistant to this mode of classification.

<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">As Table <$n#table:genre-stats> below suggests, comedies are the most straightforward networks to identify. Whereas histories and tragedies often have similar values across our metrics, comedies tend to be distinct. Their smaller casts are more interconnected, which can be visually observed in Figure <$n#fig:all-comedies> above, and can be measured in their networks’ hi...</p>

<p class="itemText">What Table <$n#table:genre-stats> above also suggests is that histories and tragedies are fairly similar genres. We interpret these results by understanding histories as representing one end of a spectrum which has comedies on the opposite end, with tragedies falling between histories and comedies.  </p>

<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Histories, as can be visually seen in in Figure <$n#fig:all-histories>, feature large and highly dispersed networks. Their peripheries are populated with large numbers of very minor characters, such as “First,” “Second,” and “Third” members of groups like soldiers and ambassadors, who each interject briefly in a single scene. (See, for example, Figure <$n#fig:richard3>, Richard III, and for an extreme case Figure <$n#fi...</p>

<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Tragedies are more formally unpredictable, especially visually, as seen in Figure <$n#fig:all-tragedies>. Some have dense cores with small peripheries that wouldn’t be out of place among the comedies (Figure <$n#fig:lear>, King Lear; Figure <$n#fig:romeo>, Romeo & Juliet). Othello, in particular, is almost claustrophobically small (Figure <$n#fig...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">hamlet node</p>
<p class="itemText">What might unite these tragedies is the increased likelihood of a “tragic hero” who appears in the network graph as a distinct, singular centre of the network. These central nodes are typically connected to a large number of other nodes which may be only sparsely connected to each other, with a disproportionately high number of heavily weighted edges connecting outward (indicating that they have given long speeches) with little to no reciprocation. In other words: a Hamlet. “Hamlet” nodes can be...</p>

<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">As our discussion of the tragedies suggests, genre is never simple. Even in evaluating accuracy, we really determine the classifier’s ability to predict how the First Folio would have labelled a work, not the work’s “true” and objective genre. Shakespearean scholars by no means universally accept the First Folio’s assignments. Accordingly, once we had trained our SVM classifier, we queried three sets ...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Roman plays</p>
<p class="itemText">The “Roman plays” are four tragedies whose ancient Roman settings place them closer to tragedy’s roots in history. We thought our classifier might re-classify them as histories; however, as Table <$n#table:roman-plays> shows, only Antony & Cleopatra, with only one classifier, was designated a history. Instead, this re-classification experiment suggest that closer attention ought to be paid to the small, dense network which makes up Titus Andronicus.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">problem, romance</p>
<p class="itemText">The “problem plays” and the “romances” are both sets of plays whose contents have proved challenging to scholars, motivating re-assessment of their generic form. As Table <$n#table:problem-plays> shows, both classifiers generally concur with the First Folio’s classification of the problem plays, with the exception that the SVM classifier identifies Troilus and Cressida as a comedy rather than a tragedy. The romances (Table <$n#table:romances>) are slightly more ambiguous. </p>

<p class="itemTitle">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Audiences since Samuel Johnson in 1765 have complained of Cymbeline’s failures as a tragedy (among other things, it has a happy ending), and Barbara Mowat refers to the Folio’s identification of the play as “The Tragedie of Cymbeline” in the index, title page, and running heads, as “misleading paratextual matter” (2003). Our classification, in contrast, supports Valerie Wayne and Richard Proudfoot’s assessment that although “[i]t is not a tragedy as that form is most widely understood today or ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Winter's Tale</p>
<p class="itemText">More strange is the classifiers’ identification of The Winter’s Tale as a history. The play earns its designation as a romance due to its two-part structure: it begins much like a tragedy, with Leontes at its centre. Halfway through, the character of “Time” comes on stage to declare that sixteen years have passed, and the play changes to a pastoral comedy which brings the play to a happy resolution. These two theatrical dynamics are visible in the social network graph, as seen in Figure <$n#fig:...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">conclusion</p>
<p class="itemText">We treat none of our classifications as definitive declaration of the plays’ “real” genres, but network analysis gives us a new way to think about their genres. Thirty-six plays is a small scale for this approach: since the parser is highly extensible and can be used with any plays encoded in TEI, future work need not be restricted to the Early Modern period. It need not even be restricted to works written in English. The purpose of these tools is to confirm some ways that we have thought about ...</p>

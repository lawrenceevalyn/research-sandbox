The thing I wish I'd known, going into graduate school, was that people were going to stop teaching me things, and I was going to have to teach myself. As a grad student, you have access to professors more as intellectual colleages -- if you want to learn new skills and domains of expertise from scratch, you're often a bit on your own.

But there's still a need to keep learning. I think it's important as a scholar to always have something new that one is learning about -- not just developing advanced expertise in familiar areas (though of course that's necessary too), but getting started as a beginner in unfamiliar areas. I consider myself a DH scholar now, but I hadnâ€™t even considered DH until well into my MA.

The approach I like has four steps:
1, think of something I'd like to be able to do;
2, find some kind of resource that can give me an introduction to that skill;
(this is usually a textbook, or sometimes a workshop)
3, think of a project using that skill which I think I can complete within a semester;
4, invent some kind of external motivation or accountability to push me to complete the project.
This is how I learned to use Excel, to speed-read, to program in Python, to read French, to analyze network graphs... and now I am working on Arabic.

"DH" can have an aura of being difficult to get started in, but,
1, literally every DH scholar at the Digital Humanities conference introduced themselves by saying "I'm not sure I'm really DH," so, if you don't feel digital enough that almost proves that you ARE digital enough.
2, nobody actually does "DH" -- everybody does a small set of very specific skills that they've honed. So you can start with just one thing.

So, the skill that took the most work was coding in Python, which took three "projects". First I did a weekend workshop. Then I read a textbook called Learn Python The Hard Way, and did all the practice exercises in it. (I used a service called Beeminder that charged me money if I didn't finish each chapter on time, to keep that project concrete.) Then I made a text adventure game for a friend's birthday, which gave me a real audience and a real deadline. Then I accepted a Research Assistantship contract to write an extremely small program to do some text processing for his research, which obviously had extremely real stakes. And now I list "Python" on my CV.

That specific approach may not work for everyone, but I do think everyone should take the time to think about how they can best support their own ongoing learning.

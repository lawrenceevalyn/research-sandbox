<p class="itemTitle">is TJ teaching us something?</p>
<p class="itemText">Henry Fielding’s Tom Jones is an oddly ambiguous text: on the level of the work as a whole, its central moral interests are hard to mistake, but on the level of the paragraph or the sentence its meaning is liable to dissolve into multilayered irony and facetiousness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">novel as experiment</p>
<p class="itemText">John Bender and Joseph Drury both see Fielding’s novel as a carefully-constructed experiment, built to educate its readers via the same method as contemporaneous science. In presenting its details of cause and effect, the novel enables the experience of “surrogate witnessing” (Bender 291, Drury 52) which formed the cornerstone of the mass transmission of eighteenth century natural philosophy experiments. Bender details a history of moral philosophers using novels the same way natural philosopher...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Welsh: novel teaches reader to distrust witnesses</p>
<p class="itemText">Situating the novel within a historical legal context, Welsh draws a distinction between externally-verifiable circumstantial evidence and biased, shifting individual testimony. Welsh establishes the increasing popularity of circumstantial evidence in the eighteenth century courts, and reads Fielding’s narrator as a prosecutor who “manages the evidence imaginatively, wittily, and triumphantly for the defense” (48). The novel, he argues, repeatedly implicates and then exonerates its characters, a...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Loftis & Power</p>
<p class="itemText">Welsh is not alone in arguing that the reader’s encounters with flawed information are meant to make the reader into a judge: John Loftis, too, looks to the novel’s legal language as teaching a mode of “judgment of character in action” that has its roots in the courtroom (17), and Henry Power’s study of the “sagacious reader” sees in Fielding “constant readiness to see the reader as a critic” whose interpretations the narrator would like to direct (763). Power, however, diverges from Welsh and L...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">character of the narrator</p>
<p class="itemText">As scholars since Wayne Booth have often noted, the flamboyantly omnipresent narrator operates as a character in his own right, with his own mercurial perspective that calls for his own critical interpretation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">"to say the truth"</p>
<p class="itemText">I turn my attention to a particular rhetorical move which draws particular attention to the narrator’s machinations: the use of the clause, “to say the truth.” A critical reader, attuned to the problems of testimony and of empiricism, immediately finds both the truth and the saying of it rendered questionable by the naming of the act: why “to say the Truth, he hesitated a little at first” (III.ii)? Why not simply “he hesitated a little at first”? In this instance, the hesitation is that of Jones...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">clauses classification</p>
<p class="itemText">Characteristically of Fielding, each individual claim to truth is accomplishing several things narratively, and the prose of each sentence eludes classification, but I have undertaken a general taxonomy of the rough features of each time the narrator call attention to his own honesty. The exact phrases considered, and their relative frequency, are represented in Figures 1 and 2. They encompass all the moments where the narrator identifies one of his statements as “truth,” as well as all the mome...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">subjects classification</p>
<p class="itemText">Within the domain of the novel, we can evaluate whether his statements are consistent with the world he presents elsewhere. As indicated in Figure 3, the majority (65%) of Fielding’s self-conscious statements of truth serve to illuminate the world of the novel itself — that is, precisely those domains over which his bare statement would have constituted truth without his insistence. Roughly half of his statements are in some way about the facts of what is happening in the narrative, with another...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">interpreting bridget</p>
<p class="itemText">This line about Bridget turns out to be by no means as straightforward as its acknowledgment of truth might appear. In its full context, provided as an explanation for Bridget’s taking “the good natured Side of the Question” regarding her brother’s adoption of Jones, the line requires multiple layers of interpretation:</p>
<p class="itemText">Perhaps the Reader may account for this Behaviour from her Condescension to Mr. Allworthy, when we have informed him, that the good Man had ended his Narrative with owning a Resol...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">clarity classification</p>
<p class="itemText"> The narrator’s other uses of this rhetorical technique are not generally so disingenuous, but neither do they tend toward clarity. As Figure 4 shows, only nine instances (11%) actively obfuscate the meaning that turns out to be most consistent with the novel’s later developments, but only twenty-four (29%) state that meaning directly. Classifying Fielding’s prose on a relative scale of obscurity is something of an exercise in madness, and yet I do stand by my assessment that the statement “to s...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">narrator only guesses char thoughts</p>
<p class="itemText">Although these appeals to truth implicitly identify the novel as something that is being “said,” barely a quarter of instances (twenty total) include a first person pronoun for who is saying them (Figure 5). For the most part, then, although these moments of “saying the truth” might highlight the constructed nature of the narrative, they distance us from the mind of the narrator himself. When the narrator is pulled into focus, he does not appear as an authority: the characteristic use of “I” in ...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Welsh: reader distrust witnesses</p>
<p class="itemText">Here we may find Alexander Welsh helpful: Sophia’s secret, spontaneous, irrational wish to be overtaken by Jones, then, is the sort of information which cannot serve as a solid proof and thus ought to be extraneous to the prosecutor’s “superior representation of the facts” (Welsh 62). And yet, of course, the narrator hasn’t concealed it, and, however much it may be qualified with “I believe” and the noncommittal “rather wished than feared,” his testimony proves useful to us. Indeed, of the fifty...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">jokes keep us from looking too closely</p>
<p class="itemText">Returning to that first invocation of “acknowledge[ing] the truth,” for example, when Bridget is unexpectedly gentle toward the infant foundling: the interpreted truth of her “muttering” gives us something to ‘get’ and enjoy so that we feel we have extracted the paragraph’s comic pleasure, and are ‘done’ with it. This is the “submission to readerly ‘Interest’” that Sharon Sherman argues drives his “management of text to everyone's material advantage” (375): the obfuscations exist not to provide ...</p>

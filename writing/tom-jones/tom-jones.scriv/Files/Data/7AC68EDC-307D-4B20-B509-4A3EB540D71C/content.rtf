Characteristically of Fielding, each individual claim to truth is accomplishing several things narratively, and the prose of each sentence eludes classification, but I have undertaken a general taxonomy of the rough features of each time the narrator call attention to his own honesty. The exact phrases considered, and their relative frequency, are represented in Figures 1 and 2. They encompass all the moments where the narrator identifies one of his statements as \'93truth,\'94 as well as all the moments where he describes his narration as \'93speak[ing]\'94 in a particular way. The narrator, of course, makes implicit claims to truth-telling throughout the novel: every time he prefaces a clause with a phrase like \'93it is true\'94 (15 counts), \'93in fact\'94 (27 counts), \'93in reality\'94 (81 counts), or, indeed, the simple adverb \'93indeed\'94 (913 counts), he positions himself as a potential authority on truth, fact, and reality. When he draws attention to the narrative \'93I\'94 behind the story, it is more commonly to suggest doubt, hedging a statement with \'93I think\'94 (135 counts), \'93I believe\'94 (196 counts), or an allusion to a fictive process of incomplete research. The \'93to speak truth\'94 moments, then, represent a distinct narrative mode in which the presence of the narrator is being explicitly called to mind, but his testimony is not usually being explicitly cast as partial and doubtful. The heavy operation of irony throughout the text, however, renders it possible for narrative assurances of all kinds to convey their opposites once contextualized, and so the first question, once these moments have been assembled, is: is he actually telling us the truth?}

Welsh is not alone in arguing that the reader\'92s encounters with flawed information are meant to make the reader into a judge: John Loftis, too, looks to the novel\'92s legal language as teaching a mode of \'93judgment of character in action\'94 that has its roots in the courtroom (17), and Henry Power\'92s study of the \'93sagacious reader\'94 sees in Fielding \'93constant readiness to see the reader as a critic\'94 whose interpretations the narrator would like to direct (763). Power, however, diverges from Welsh and Loftis\'92s assessment that the reader\'92s judgments are instructive. Welsh argues that Fielding\'92s irony, his circumlocutions, and his calculated almost-inferences serve didactic aims \'93by repeatedly calling on the reader to take a second look\'94 (50), but on the second look, the things we might discover will bring us no closer to divining the truth. Fielding\'92s meticulous plot is, indeed, internally consistent such that the traces of its various twists are visible in retrospect, but not everything visible in retrospect can reasonably form the basis of an accurate prediction. Instead of improving our judgment, the narrator\'92s rhetorical techniques work to make our second look nearly as uninformative as the first. As Power says, despite the linguistic effusions giving the impression of an author \'93who finds it hard not to offer the benefit of his Inspiration,\'94 \'93[t]o anyone reading the work for a second time, it will be apparent that Fielding has done an excellent job of containing himself\'94 (762).}

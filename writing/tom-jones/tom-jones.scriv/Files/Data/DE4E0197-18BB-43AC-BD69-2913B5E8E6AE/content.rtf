\f0\fs22 \cf0 Can Tom Jones be usefully contrasted with an Austen novel? Someone with almost the opposite prose style \'97 famous for finally making the narrator disappear into the characters \'97 but with a similar tension between an impeccable, re-readable plot and page-turning enjoyment.\
The Wickham scenes in P&P, maybe?\
Or something in S&S?\
It\'92s got to be P&P, S&S, or Persuasion, for the scenes of a heroine trying to understand someone else, and the reader being given some extra information, but not quite enough information.}

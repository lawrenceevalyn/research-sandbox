Michael McKeon, The Origins of the English Novel: 1600\'961740 (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press), 119, 404.\
"Michael McKeon\'92s thesis that what distinguishes Fielding from his more realistic peers is less a regress in literary time than a recuperation of tradition qualified by the terms of modernity. While McKeon contrasts the \'93naive empiricism\'94 of Defoe and Richardson with Fielding\'92s \'93extreme skepticism,\'94 he does not see the latter as anti- empirical. Extreme scepticism, in McKeon\'92s dialectical frame- work, is instead an \'93untenably negative midpoint\'94 between the idealism of romance and the empiricism of the realist novel, a midpoint \'93in constant danger of becoming each of them by turns.\'94 McKeon\'92s account does justice to both Fielding\'92s reliance on romance conventions and to \'93the crucial degree to which he is in accord with the empiricist perspective.\'946 Parlaying this insight into an empiricist reading of Fielding is not the goal for McKeon, who focuses instead on how Fielding invokes empiricism as a standard of truth against romance. And this leaves open the question of what the standard requires of Fielding himself once it is in place, and of how Fielding responds to it\'97if at all." ([[202001200154 Maioli 2014]] 204)}

I turn my attention to a particular rhetorical move which draws particular attention to the narrator\'92s machinations: the use of the clause, \'93to say the truth.\'94 A critical reader, attuned to the problems of testimony and of empiricism, immediately finds both the truth and the saying of it rendered questionable by the naming of the act: why \'93to say the Truth, he hesitated a little at first\'94 (III.ii)? Why not simply \'93he hesitated a little at first\'94? In this instance, the hesitation is that of Jones in insisting that he was alone in his semi-accidental poaching; the clause \'93to say the truth\'94 somewhat replicates Jones\'92s hesitation, and marks his discomfort with lying. This instance is a narratively suitable moment to hesitate and qualify an assertion, but not an isolated one. Fielding\'92s narrator employs the rhetorical move of explicitly \'93saying the truth\'94 extensively \'97 eighty-two times across the text \'97 with sufficient variation that they merit a sustained examination.}

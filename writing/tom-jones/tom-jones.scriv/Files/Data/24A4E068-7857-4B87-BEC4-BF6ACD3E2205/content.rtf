Situating the novel within a historical legal context, Welsh draws a distinction between externally-verifiable circumstantial evidence and biased, shifting individual testimony. Welsh establishes the increasing popularity of circumstantial evidence in the eighteenth century courts, and reads Fielding\'92s narrator as a prosecutor who \'93manages the evidence imaginatively, wittily, and triumphantly for the defense\'94 (48). The novel, he argues, repeatedly implicates and then exonerates its characters, a pattern which \'93teaches the reader to distrust the witnesses and await more facts\'94 (62), and particularly to discount testimony and await verifiable evidence.}

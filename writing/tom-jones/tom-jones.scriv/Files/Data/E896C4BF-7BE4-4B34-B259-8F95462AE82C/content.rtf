Here we may find Alexander Welsh helpful: Sophia\'92s secret, spontaneous, irrational wish to be overtaken by Jones, then, is the sort of information which cannot serve as a solid proof and thus ought to be extraneous to the prosecutor\'92s \'93superior representation of the facts\'94 (Welsh 62). And yet, of course, the narrator hasn\'92t concealed it, and, however much it may be qualified with \'93I believe\'94 and the noncommittal \'93rather wished than feared,\'94 his testimony proves useful to us. Indeed, of the fifty-two truth statements for which this distinction is meaningful, twenty-seven (52%) provide testimony to some kind on interior state (Figure 7). These also tend to directly incorporate the narrator\'92s voice: five of the six \'93I believe\'94 statements are comments on characters\'92 interior states. The sixth, a comment on writing \'97 \'93I believe many a hearty Curse hath been devoted on the Head of that Author who first instituted [\'85] the Prologue\'94 (XVI.i) \'97 rather continues the trend than disrupts it. Moreover, statements on external fact are nearly three times as likely (20% vs 7%) to be obfuscatory than testimony to characters inner states. When the narrator asserts a truth, then, he seems to rely almost equally on testimony and circumstantial evidence, and while nonetheless showing the limitations of each.}

# Notes on Banting

Really is a more lay and interdisciplinary audience than previous grants -- committees are cross-disciplinary, like, philosophy and astrophysics

Samples are very diverse in approach, rhetoric, and structure -- a set of strategies that can be used as inspiration
* Claire's ranked *incredibly* high

A proposal is a PITCH: trying to "sell" a project to "investors" -- they are academics, but wearing a different hat

At this stage, it would be hard to really boost your publication record. Also can't really change reference letters. But the proposal is in your control.


Purpose of a proposal is to convince the committee that the project is original, important, and feasible
1. Give the big picture: why should readers care?
* Address the world beyond the project, in the field and beyond the field.
* Show how your research plan / methodology fits into the project's larger goals -- not just a recipe, but show the reasons for the research steps
2. Don't drown readers in detail: do your readers *really* need to know?
3. State rationales: why *this* project? *this* approach? *this* text? *this* case study? Add little clauses like "In order to ___, ..."

The abstract can become an outline for the four-page proposal.
* After today's workshop, write a new version from scratch
* Then scaffold up to 1000 words, get some readers to read it, build it up more...

Contacting supervisors
* Banting is a bit more work for the institution, but people seem really open to SSHRC
* Tactfully introduce connections that exist
* Make sure they know what SSHRC is
* VERY brief explanation of project, offer fuller proposal if they're interested
* Attach a CV, to save them having to ask for it
* Make it clear to them whether you actually intend to go there

How important is the fit between the project and the institution/supervisor?
* They do have to write a letter
* For Banting, the supervisor is absolutely crucial -- Banting has significant involvement of supervisor & institution even for preparing the application

SSHRC and Banting postdocs ARE taxable income
Might need to pay student fees

What should be the outcome?
* Differs based on field -- in some like psychology, articles are the real focus. But in literature, the ultimate outcome is likely a book, with some articles along the way (signal progress to book during the time).
* Make sure what you say is feasible -- but both feasible and ambitious

Project the sense that the project is well-planned and some initial contacts have been made, but it's fundamentally future work: don't make it sound like all of the work is done.

Try not to "sound like a graduate student" -- when asking for feedback, ask them to help identify places where you're signalling lack of confidence, over-bowing to the literature, etc.

# Notes on others' abstracts

## Christina
* I think the opening is actually "as legal historians like Patricia Seed have detailed, the house—and its botanical correlate, the garden—is the basis for law in common law jurisdictions with British imperial roots"
* I also feel like I want to know why you're looking at contemporary literature, when the framing is about the older roots of law/literature -- presumably to see how these frameworks are still relevant today?

## Cynthia
* Importance is extremely clear!
* Abstract could be shorter? Seems repetititve, and should just be one paragraph?
* Add instead what "a political economy analysis" is?
* Combine into one sentence: "This project follows from my doctoral research looking at electronic waste recycling and global markets for scrap metal. The research concludes that we cannot effectively analyze the mining and recycling of metal resources without considering the political economy of global metal and mineral markets."


## Delbar
* really need to introduce what the field is and its core stakes are earlier in the abstract.
* I also think smaller sentences / simpler vocabulary would help
* "the politicization of the Shi’a Islam" seems like the germ of what is important, but I don't have the background to know what that actually means

## Email to Wendy Chun

Hello Dr. Chun,

We met at MLA [year] in New York, and more recently when you gave a wonderful talk at the University of Toronto. [Maybe mention other links.]

I know you have come to Canada relatively recently, so you may not be familiar with the Banting postdoc -- it's an ambitious

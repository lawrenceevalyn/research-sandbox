\f0\fs22 \cf0 Although our parser has not solved the problem of guessing the specific addressees of a character\'92s speech, and instead tracks characters present on stage during speech, its simplifications allow it to be remarkably extensible. It could be used to parse any play that follows TEI P5 guidelines for performance texts. Each speaking character is connected to all characters currently present on stage. These connections are recorded in a network graph, with characters as nodes and shared speech as edges. Edges are directional, and weighted based on the number of lines spoken.}

<p class="binderItem"><strong>abstract</strong><br/>[This paper asks how to identify and discuss gendered trends.] This paper examines more than five hundred pre-Victorian Gothic works to ask whether female writers created categorically different works than their male peers, [looking for predictive power.] Two qualitative bibliographies of the Gothic provide “motifs” and “Gothic types” for computational modelling.  [There’s no female gothic, but there is a male gothic.]</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>what makes a trend gendered?</strong><br/>How are we to identify or discuss gendered trends in literature? My answer: have to look at at least a hundred texts. [DH marries nuance with scale]</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Ledoux: Female Gothic isn't real</strong><br/>My project ultimately reinforces Ledoux’s argument that the Female Gothic is a retroactive critical creation. Her history of the criticism sounds about right to me; it was the same deification of Radcliffe that first sent me examining her supposed mass of “copiers.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>lit review</strong><br/>Ledoux is part of a refreshing tide of criticism bringing attention to the diversity of women’s writing outside the restrictive theme of the “Female Gothic”<br/>
As far back as Clery (2000) there has been a call to be attentive to the diversity of women’s Gothic writing. In 2016 Horner & Zlosnik do X to try to see this call through.</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>need predictive power</strong><br/>My answer: the supposedly distinguishing element ought to have predictive power</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Frank shows a female Gothic</strong><br/>Frank’s female Gothic sounds familiar</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Radcliffe is a weirdo</strong><br/>The things that we might expect — subterannean passages and caves — are just Radcliffe.</p>

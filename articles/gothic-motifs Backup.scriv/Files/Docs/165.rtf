This women\'92s Gothic does also appear to be a \'93school of Radcliffe\'94. [Because of] Frank\'92s interest in the sources of various works, his \'93Gothic types\'94 mention specific authors by name for nearly a quarter of the works in his bibliography. Of those 114 works, 58 have Radcliffe as their precedent, [making her the \'93mother\'94 for] just over half the works with a named source. After Radcliffe comes Lewis, with 13 imitators, then Walpole (12), Clara Reeve (6), and Charlotte Smith (5). [Radcliffe\'92s followers are disproportionately women (38 of the 58, 66%), and Lewis\'92s are disproportionately men (6 of the 13, 46% \'97 well above the 31% male baseline in the corpus)] [Thus Frank suggests the female school of Radcliffe which proved so invisible in Tracy.] [This didn\'92t show up in Tracy because it doesn\'92t operate by identifiable motif (though it also doesn\'92t contradict Tracy)]}

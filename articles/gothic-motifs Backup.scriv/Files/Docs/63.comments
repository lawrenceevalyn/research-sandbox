\f0\fs20 \cf0 First, Frank\'92s phrases were split so that each word became one tag. Radcliffe\'92s The Italian, listed as \'93Pure or high Gothic (terror and horror modes)\'94 becomes \'93Pure\'94, \'93or\'94, \'93high\'94, \'93Gothic\'94, \'93terror\'94, \'93horror\'94, and \'93modes.\'94 Then, conjunctions were deleted, and synonyms combined. Frank always uses the phrase \'93Pure or high\'94 in its entirety, for example, so the tags \'93Pure\'94, \'93or\'94, and \'93high\'94 were merged into one tag \'93Pure;high\'94. }]]></Comment>

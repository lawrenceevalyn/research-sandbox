More than half of the motifs under consideration are not strongly gendered in either direction. Four are even perfect ties: elopement (all subcategories); dueling and other single combat; fainting, female; and rediscovery of lost relatives. Moreover, the more popular a motif is \'97 that is, the larger a role it plays in constituting the default expectations of the genre \'97 the more likely it is to be non-gendered. Indeed, all of the strongly male-dominated motifs are much less common than the more neutral motifs. The neutrality of the most popular motifs is essentially a mathematical inevitability: nothing can achieve more than 50% popularity while being used by only 50% of authors. The Gothic mainstream must be defined by that which is available to all authors within the genre. In terms of sheer prevalence, the defining features of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://091D65AF-F81D-441F-8C65-E02357AC05BB"}}{\fldrslt Gothic}} appear to be fainting (present in 77% of all novels), confinement (66% of novels), abduction (57%), references to suicide (47%), and storms (44%). Only one of those five motifs, suicide (61% male), shows hints of a gendered divide.}

<p class="itemText"># Introduction</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Our inquiry considers the speech interactions of characters within plays as a proxy for broad narrative structures. We analyze computationally-generated social networks of 37 plays by Shakespeare to see whether, and how, they can be used to distinguish between Shakespeare’s comedies, tragedies, and histories.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Because dramatic performances enact social encounters, social network analysis translates surprisingly well to fictional societies. Stiller et al. have shown that social ne...</p>

<p class="itemText"># Methods</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">We built a parser that turns TEI-encoded plays into social network graphs.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Our parser uses the <role> and <who> tags to build a cast list for each play, and proceeds through the play using <div> tags to determine scene boundaries. Scenes are further subdivided into “blocks” based on character exits and entrances, to track who is on stage throughout the scene. If a character speaks or is mentioned in a stage direction, and has not been named in an exit, they are assumed to be present ...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">validated on shakey</p>
<p class="itemText">To verify that our tool is accurate, we compare our generated network of Hamlet to Moretti’s well-known handmade model of that play (2011). Despite some minor differences in how we handle the most peripheral characters like “Servant”, the two networks are highly similar. In both, Hamlet has the highest node centrality (the measure of connectedness which Moretti uses as a proxy for his status as protagonist) and highest node degree (the number of times he speaks or is spoken to), with Claudius, G...</p>

<p class="itemText"># Findings</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Using a computational parser also allows us to easily expand our comparisons to the rest of Shakespeare’s oeuvre.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Using fivefold validation, we were able to show that social networks can be used to identify whether plays are labelled as tragedy, history, comedy. We considered 17 different mathematical features of the networks; no one feature was sufficient to identify the genre, though “graph density” came closest (83% accuracy). One combination which does achieve 100% accuracy is “...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">conclusion: extensibility</p>
<p class="itemText">The networks thus provide a framework for discussion of the plays’ structure separately from their content. 37 plays is a small scale for this approach: future work will expand beyond a single author.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Our parser successfully and rapidly produces sophisticated social network graphs of marked up plays. We have used these networks as a supplement to close-reading Shakespeare’s oeuvre, and as a tool to explore complex relationships between Early Modern theatrical genres.</p>

<p class="itemText">Our first 37 networks are ...</p>

<p class="itemText">The most exciting part about all of this, for me, is that the program ought to be able to run on any TEI-encoded play. I’m personally hoping to use it on a corpus I’m building of eighteenth century plays in English and French, but we would love to hear from scholars who have their own corpora of TEI-encoded plays which they’d like to explore as social networks.</p>

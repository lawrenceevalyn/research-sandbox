<p class="itemTitle">Introduction</p>
<p class="itemText">Our inquiry considers the speech interactions of characters within plays as a proxy for broad narrative structures. We analyze computationally-generated social networks of 37 plays by Shakespeare to see whether, and how, they can be used to distinguish between Shakespeare’s comedies, tragedies, and histories.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Because dramatic performances enact social encounters, social network analysis translates surprisingly well to fictional societies. Stiller et al. have shown that social networks in Shakes...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Creation of Social Network Graphs</p>
<p class="itemText">Although our parser has not solved the problem of guessing the specific addressees of a character’s speech, and instead tracks characters present on stage during speech, its simplifications allow it to be remarkably extensible. It could be used to parse any play that follows TEI P5 guidelines for performance texts. Each speaking character is connected to all characters currently present on stage. These connections are recorded in a network graph, with characters as nodes and shared speech as edg...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Using Networks to Identify Genre</p>
<p class="itemText">We then use our generated network graphs to test our central question: whether the social network enacted by a play’s characters can be used as a proxy for features of the play’s narrative content. More specifically, we ask whether social networks can be used to distinguish between the dramatic genres of tragedy, comedy, and history. Using a support vector machine with fivefold validation, we tested 17 different mathematical features of the networks. No single feature was independently sufficien...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">History, Comedy, Tragedy</p>
<p class="itemText">The potential utility of graph density in distinguishing genres is visually obvious when individual comedy and history networks are compared. Histories feature highly dispersed networks, with large numbers of very minor characters, such as “First,” “Second,” and “Third” members of groups like soldiers and ambassadors, who each interject briefly in a single scene. Connections form chains of acquaintance with little overlap, so even the monarchs have low eigenvector centrality.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">The "Problem Plays"</p>
<p class="itemText">We then use our preliminary identification of each genre’s features to examine Shakespeare’s various contested genres. Training our model only on the plays for which there is strong consensus, we applied it to the “Roman plays,” the “problem plays,” and the “romances” in turn. Of the Roman plays, all but Antony and Cleopatra are identified as tragedies by every metric; Antony and Cleopatra is identified as a history by “edges, words, and degree” and as a comedy by “degree, modularity, and densit...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Conclusion</p>
<p class="itemText">Our parser successfully and rapidly produces sophisticated social network graphs of TEI plays, which can be used to computationally identify theatrical genre in Shakespeare’s plays. Thirty-seven plays is a small scale for this approach: since the parser is highly extensible and can be used with any plays encoded in TEI, future work need not be restricted to the Early Modern period. It need not even be restricted to works written in English. Our networks of the well-studied works of Shakespeare c...</p>

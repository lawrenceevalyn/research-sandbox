\f0\fs22 \cf0 To verify that our parser is accurate, we compare our generated network of Hamlet to Moretti\'92s well-known handmade model of that play (2011). Despite some minor differences in how we handle the most peripheral characters like \'93Servant\'94, and our less-minor difference in including the play-within-the-play, the two networks are highly similar. In both, Hamlet has the highest node centrality (the measure of connectedness which Moretti uses as a proxy for his status as protagonist) and highest node degree (the number of times he speaks or is spoken to), with Claudius, Gertrude, and Horatio similar but lagging behind. We concur with Moretti\'92s literary interpretation of these mathematical features.\
\
Our tool improves on Moretti\'92s model by adding direction and weight to each connection. Although this level of detail turned out not to be necessary for the basic task of using network graphs to distinguish between Shakespeare\'92s genres, it may be useful in future work examining a less homogenous corpus of plays, or in work asking different questions about this corpus.}

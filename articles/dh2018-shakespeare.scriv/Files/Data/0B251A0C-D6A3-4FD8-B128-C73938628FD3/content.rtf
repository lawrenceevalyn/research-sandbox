\f0\fs22 \cf0 With this preliminary validation we can step back and look at Shakespeare\'92s various contested genres. The \'93problem plays\'94 look unproblematically like comedies, suggesting that it\'92s their content rather than their form which makes them problematic. Similarly, the \'93Roman plays\'94 are unquestionably tragedies, not histories, with the possible exception of Antony and Cleopatra. However, the hybrid form of the \'93romances\'94 or \'93tragicomedies\'94 is more structural: the edges and degree are what dominate and place the romances squarely into comedies, even though the words are more like the tragedies (i.e., shorter).  So, the structure of the social network says "Comedy" but the length of the play says "Tragedy.\'94}

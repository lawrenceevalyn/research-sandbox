\f0\fs22 \cf0 Using fivefold validation, we were able to show that social networks can be used to identify whether plays are labelled as tragedy, history, comedy. We considered 17 different mathematical features of the networks; no one feature was sufficient to identify the genre, though \'93graph density\'94 came closest (83% accuracy). One combination which does achieve 100% accuracy is \'93edges, words, and degree\'94. (Other combos might also be able to do it, including maybe a pair, but one combo is sufficient to prove that ID based on network is possible.)}

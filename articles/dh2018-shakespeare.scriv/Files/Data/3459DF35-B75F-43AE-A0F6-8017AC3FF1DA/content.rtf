\f0\fs22 \cf0 Our inquiry considers the speech interactions of characters within plays as a proxy for narrative structure. We generated social networks from XML marked up editions of all of Shakespeare\'92s plays. The networks capture character speech as a directional connection between the speaker and all characters present to hear their speech, weighted by the number of words spoken. We explore correlations between the mathematical properties of the networks and dramatic genre. We have also made these networks available and manipulable online. These networks may be of interest to scholars of Shakespeare, and allow another approach to discussions of generic hybridity in early modern drama. The project as a whole may also provide a way to make comparisons within large corpora of plays.}

Title: she-tragedy
Author: Lawrence Evalyn

# abstract #

Nicholas Rowe coined the term “she-tragedy” in 1714 to refer to a recently successful kind of tragedy, which takes advantage of the still-new presence of actresses on the Restoration stage to present spectables of female suffering. She-tragedies took pathetic tragedy to its logical extreme, and were extremely different from the heroic dramas that pre-dated them. The characteristic marginalization-yet-theatrical-power is captured in the dynamics of the play’s social network, as the heroines speak at great length but to few people and little effect, in contrast to the debates and wide-ranging social circulation of the central male figures in heroic dramas. The most mesmerizing she-tragedy heroines instead speak directly to their audiences. As theatrical tastes shift toward bourgeois drama, it seems as if women remain marginalized through their continued alliance with the domestic, but in fact a shift occurs in the amount of agency they are able to show. As the mere presence of an actress on the stage becomes more familiar, the theatrical/social activities of heroines and heroes become more similar. 
Can I tell which plays were less impressive as she-tragedies because their heroines speak less to the audience?
My article is about how and why the heroines of tragedies went from being socially proscribed to occupying the same structural plot roles as male heroes of tragedies over the course of the long 18th century.
Something about the shift from heroic drama to pathetic tragedy and back again? My argument may be that, when theatrical tastes shift away from pathetic tragedy and toward bourgeois drama, this doesn’t look like a change in women’s status on the stage, but it actually is, because they get more agency.
But I need way more proof than I have for those claims.
What I’ve actually shown is that my social networks can detect the difference between a heroic drama and a pathetic tragedy. Agency and speech are intimately connected in plays (as makes sense). Although she-tragedy heroines are marginalized in the world of their plays, they make direct claims on the audience’s sympathy; they are distinct from the heroic drama before and the bourgeois drama after in their attempt to speak directly out from the stage.

Venice Preserv’d (1682), The Grecian Daughter (1772)

I think my new argument is that, when women are first introduced to tragedies their mere spectacular presence is sufficient to make an enormous impression on the audience — but as the genre of she-tragedy is established, the heroines become more similar to the male heroes they displace.
(Does this reflect some kind of changing attitude about women’s agency?)

# convo with Veronica #

belvidera: precursor to domestic novel, shouldn't be interesting to hear her reactions to things she has no role in but it is

Veronica's telling: article doesn't know what it's big signifcant claim is just yet, but it has all its evidence; two plays that do two very different things with she-tragedy heroines, and both work but they occur on either side of a century -- my task is to find out how one turns into the other. 

tragic heroine played by an actual woman -- still had novelty
totally different experience for the audience, in post-rape scene with hair down and clothes torn; 
written specifically for Elizabeth Barry at the height of her fame

Cassandra figure -- no one believes her

Grecian Daughter maybe keyed to change in female protagonists in novels around 60s; a new burst of active female protagonists because passive heroines are boring

How long was Venice Preservd still staged?
Who played Euphrasia? Mrs Barry???

My article is about how and why the heroines of tragedies went from being socially proscribed to occupying the same structural plot roles as male heroes of tragedies over the course of the long 18th century.

Lawrence’s article uses (what will be) a formidable data set to think about the changes in the sociability and activity of the tragic heroine across the long 18th c.

# wikipedia on she-tragedy #

When English drama was reborn in 1660 with the re-opening of the theatres, the leading tragic style was the male-dominated heroic dramawhich celebrated powerful, aggressively masculine heroes and their pursuit of glory, as rulers and conquerors as well as lovers. In the 1670s and 1680s, a gradual shift occurred from heroic to pathetic tragedy, where the subject was love and domestic concerns, even though the main characters might be public figures. After the phenomenal success of Elizabeth Barry in moving the audience to tears in the role of Monimia in Otway's The Orphan, she-tragedy became the dominant form of pathetic tragedy and remained highly popular for nearly half a century.


She tragedies are known for having focused on the hardships of women rather than those suffered by men. A she-tragedy during the 1680s derived its power from the ability to create titillating scenes that portrayed the suffering of an innocent woman.[4] Pathetic tragedies would begin by presenting the heroine and establishing that she was desirable. Unlike the other popular new genre, horror, the she-tragedy did not depend on violence and gore to become the spectacle of the heroine but rather used the physical suffering that was inflicted on the blameless female victims.[5] The women, who were the subject of the play, would usually become victims of adversity and crimes that sexually exploited them such as rape or unsolicited adultery. During the scenes of rape the woman would be abducted and carried off stage. The act of rape, or adultery, would be conveyed to the audience by screams from the woman as the villain completed the evil deed. After the scene the woman would return onstage. Evidences of ravished womanhood such as disheveled hair, disordered clothing, and phallic dagger were trademark of Restoration rape and prominent in she-tragedy.[6] Playwrights would utilize other ill fortune such as the loss of a husband or child and a single mother's struggle to raise her children as another means of causing hardship in the heroine's life. After suffering these hardships throughout the play the female protagonist would be overcome by madness, commit suicide or murder as a result of the burden with which she had suffered.[7] The success of a she-tragedy was dependent upon the emotion that the actress conveyed to the audience, but the emotion that the audience felt as they watched the performance. She-tragedy also focused on making the heroine and not the hero the focus of the play. Attention would be placed on the female actress and her sexuality as playwrights used specific dialogue and devices to focus on the sexuality of the woman. One example of this is seen in The Orphan by Otway. In a scene Monimia is accompanied by a page who states to her "Madam, Indeed I'd serve you with my soul; But n the morning when you call me to you As by your bed I stand and tell you stories, I am asham'd to see your swelling Breasts, It makes me blush, they are so very white." (1.221-25) Here Otway is directing the audience's eyes to the actress' breasts, making her the focal point, and also sexualizing the actress and the character of Monima.[8]

## french and german too ##

Because my method is interested only in who speaks to whom, and relies only on TEI, I can easily consider French and German plays without being able to read them!

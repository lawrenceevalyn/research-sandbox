The most exciting part about all of this, for me, is that the program ought to be able to run on any TEI-encoded play. I’m personally hoping to use it on a corpus I’m building of eighteenth century plays in English and French, but we would love to hear from scholars who have their own corpora of TEI-encoded plays which they’d like to explore as social networks.

            <Title>B as object of exchange</Title>
            <Text>Of our three central characters, Belvidera only interacts on stage with Jaffeir; despite her role as a mediator between the conspiracy and the senate, she does not create social connections between the two groups, but instead mediates her relationships between her father or her husband. These constraints are classically patriarchal; David Hughes argues, via Eve Kosofsky-Sedgwick’s work, that Venice Preserv’d “[uses] women as currency in the maintenance of male relationships” (378), and Belvidera’s role as an object of exchange is certainly apparent in the mercenary vocabulary he highlights. But it is also apparent in the conversational dynamics when she is on stage, and particularly in the scene discussed above where she is given over to Renault. Most of the conspirators leave the stage before she is brought out, and once she arrives, as noted above, she speaks to no one but Jaffeir until she cannot avoid doing otherwise. Belvidera and Pierre actually share the stage at this point, for a significant stretch of time, but neither verbally acknowledges the other. In this way, despite having the potential to create a wide range of social connections, out of decorum she is shielded from all but the fatal Renault, while Jaffeir strengthens his own social bonds through her. Belvidera’s method of bridging groups is thus functionally opposite to the Duke’s: rather than speaking to and between both sides, others speak to each other about her.</Text>

            <Title>what if we model the audience?</Title>
            <Text>Within the fictive world of the play, the character’s various asides and soliloquies are addressed to no one. But in the theatre in which the play is staged, they represent a character’s most direct address to the audience itself. An alternative way to model the play, then, is to include the audience as a character embedded within the network, as in Figure 9. The fictional social connections have been grayed out in order to render more visible the connections between character and audience, rendered in blue. The overall shape of the network doesn’t change dramatically with this inclusion, but this figure does reveal an imbalance in who gets to address the audience: Belvidera, Priuli, “Senators,” and Antonio all represent the senate at great length, and only Renault speaks for the conspirators. Jaffeir and Aquilina, their allegiances mixed, also address the audience. Pierre, despite his outsized influence within the world of the play, is mute along this axis. Perhaps this is why Gruber is able to sdebate “Pierre's status as villain” (163): although he speaks at great length in the play, none of his appeals are made to the audience, potentially excluding us from identification with his principles and motivations.</Text>

            <Title>audience is on Euphrasia's side</Title>
            <Text>Here, again, a comparison with The Grecian Daughter proves instructive. When that play is modelled with the audience as a character, is appears thus: (figure 10) The inclusion of the audience as a node here does change the shape. Dionysius’s part of the network is now slightly more marginalized. More importantly, the audience itself has clearly chosen a side in the conflict: Dionysius may address the audience, but the node remains clustered with Evander, Melanthon, Philotas, Arcas, and, of course, Euphrasia. This physical location of the note in the graph is determined by a repeated pattern of speeh in the play which the audience is provided privileged access to these characters’ assessment of events and invited to join in their opinions. In Act IV, for example, Euphrasia’s confrontation with Dionysius several times provides the audience with her true feelings before she responds to Dionysius himself. The audience recieves not only first priority, but also sincerity: Euphrasia politely inquires of Dionysius, “And has thy heart / Felt for the wretched?”, but first she exclaims to us that he is a “Vile dissembler! / Detested homicide!” (50); when he offers to allow her a visit to her father, she says to him, “Tho' much I languish to behold my father, / Yet now it were not fit—approaching night—”, but first she clarifies to the audience that “This will discover all; / I’ll perish first; provoke his utmost rage” (51). In both cases, the former statement ensures that the audience has no chance of being taken in by the deception of the second statement. Euphrasia final aside to the audience is in Act V, immediately prior to her attack on Dionysius. Her line, “Now one glorious effort!”, gives us a forewarning that is not afforded to Dionysius, whom she interrupts mid-sentence with her dagger. In this final confrontation, Dionysius, too, addresses a few of his thoughts to the audience, but only when the stage is empty. Accordingly, rather than serving to include the audience in a conversation, his speeches function more as announcements of intent which the audience happens to overhear. Moreover, the content of his thoughts— “By Heav'n, the Greek hath offered to my sword / An easy prey; a sacrifice to glut / My great revenge” (50) or “Evander dies this night:—Euphrasia too / Shall be dispos'd of. Curse on Phocion's fraud, / That from my pow'r withdrew their infant boy” (62), for example — reveals an unpalatable bloodthirstiness, targeting dishonourably the “easy prey” of a captive or of an infant. These monologues are antisocial, both in their violent content and in the context in which the audience receives them. In contrast, by decoding her actions for the audience, Euphrasia’s speech treats the audience as a third member of her conversation, and positions the audience in sympathy with her and in opposition with Dionysius. A repellant connection is, in the network map, a connection nonetheless, but because Dionysius’s antisocial monologues are brief and infrequent compared to the intepretation Euphrasia consistently provides to the audience, and because Euphrasia’s allies imitate her mode of inclusive commentary whereas Dionysius’s imitate his exclusion, the position of the audience’s node is accurately shaped by the social connections that encourage the audience’s sympathies to align with Euphrasia’s family.</Text>

            <Title>Zone of death: Renault</Title>
            <Text>Moretti’s reading of Hamlet, in contrast, is almost entirely interested in characters’ relative positions within the network, with speech as simply a useful symptom of a social connection. Nonetheless, his conclusions provide a useful starting place for my own inquiry into Venice Preserv’d. The first thing Moretti locates in his model of Hamlet is a structural principle for who lives and dies: except for Horatio and Osric, every character with social ties to both Hamlet and Claudius dies. This arrangement of death is used to support his argument about the play’s conflicting social worlds: “what is truly deadly,” he says, “is the characters’ position in the network, chained to the warring poles of king and prince. Outside of that red region, no one dies in Hamlet” (4). Moretti’s discovery here is useful as a concrete example of the way that a model can, “like an X-ray,” reveal elements of a works which are otherwise “hidden by the very richness of the play” (5). But it also provides a baseline of comparison for an exploration of Venice Preserv’d. In a play about corruption, is there one corrupting force whose influence is fatal? In a play about divided loyalties, are there two sides between which it is deadly to be caught? Based on my Figures 2 and 3, the answer seems to be the former: despite a large body of criticism discussing Pierre’s dangerous influence, the truly corrupting companion appears to be Renault.</Text>

            <Title>Centrality: Pierre, Jaffeir, Duke</Title>
            <Text>Whereas Moretti’s identification of a ‘region of death’ in Hamlet has thus been fruitful both for readings of Hamlet and for Venice Preserv’d, his next observation is of the kind that sometimes leads to scornful dismissals of literary modelling: after careful mathematical analysis, he says, the protagonist of Hamlet, it turns out, is Hamlet (5). However, few plays are as intent in their psychological identification with a character as Hamlet, and often — as with Venice Preserv’d —  “who is the protagonist?” is a complex question. It’s helpful, therefore, that Moretti has provided a proof that the measure he uses does produce the right answer. The measure itself comes from a large-scale study of the Marvel comics universe, which identified the centre of the social network as “the character that minimized the sum of the distances to all other vertices” (Alberich 9). Moretti translates “centre” to “protagonist.” In other words, this formula identifies the character through whom most connections across the network flow, the crux of the social interchange. This way of thinking, in keeping with Moretti’s priorities, treats the protagonist as a position created by the text itself, which is important “[n]ot for what is ‘in’ it; not for its essence, but for its function” (Moretti 5). This is a different metric than that by which some critics have identified Belvidera, and others Jaffeir, as the protagonist of Venice Preserv’d: Belvidera and Jaffeir linger in our memories due to the impact of their presence and the extent to which the audience takes up their emotions as its own. Nonetheless, it is worth asking, if we see the protagonist in functional terms, as the person who brings the play’s characters together, who fills that role?</Text>

            <Title>J betrays B by connecting her to R</Title>
            <Text>If Renault is the source of danger in the play, Belvidera is doomed from the very moment Jaffeir gives her over to his control. The lines that entangle Belvidera the two of them are few. Belvidera pleads with Jaffeir to speak to her, and, already usurping Bedamore’s right to speak, Renault rebukes her: “Rise, madam, and command amongst your servants!” (II.iii.219). The content of his speech reinforces the act: even before Jaffeir has left, Renault sees fit to address and even to issue orders to Belvidera. When Jaffeir ignores Belvidera’s pleas and instead provides Renault with his dagger, Belvidera acknowledges the new connection by reciprocating Renault’s speech: 

“Nay, take my life, since he has sold it cheaply,
Or send me to some distant clime your slave,
But let it be far off, least my complainings
Should reach his guilty ears, and shake his peace.” (II.iii.227-30)
Bevidera’s consideration of the reach of her “complainings” also reflects an understanding that the ability to speak to someone represents the beginning of a social claim upon them: if Jaffeir is obliged to hear her, it may “shake his peace,” but if she can be brought out of his hearing their tie will be severed.  The same understanding of speech is expressed in the plea itself: “Speak to me” (II.iii.214) she begs, before she is given over to Renault, and, afterward, “Look on me, tell me, tell me, speak”(II.iii.240) as Renault and Bedamore carry her away. These unmet demands reflect the implicit belief that to speak to her must mean to acknowledge her— hence the inclusion of “look on me” as a parallel command— and that this acknowledgement would be incompatible with the severing of their social tie. By speaking to Renault instead of Belvidera, therefore, and leaving Belvidera with no choice but to address Renault directly herself, Jaffeir does not only use her as an object through which he shores up his own connection to the group, but implicates her in the danger herself.</Text>

            <Title>Clustering: conspirators</Title>
            <Text>To achieve a low number of degrees of separation, a character needs to speak to a large percentae of the characters in the play. To achieve the lowest number, that character must speak to people outside their own social circle. Among the conspirators, for example, Brabe, Branveil, Durhand, Mezzana, Restrosi, Revillido, Ternon, and Theodore all have the identical average degrees of separaton of 1.93. This number is high because they don’t, for the most part, speak to each other — they speak as a group to Bedamar, the Duke, Elliott, Jaffeir, Pierre, Renault, and Spinosa, and are then connected back to each other through those connections. Spinosa and Elliott, who both have an average of 1.68 degrees of separation from the characters of the play, have a lower number because they do connect directly to this mass of conspirators. But they are nonetheless tied because, as long as both remain only within their circle, neither can lower his number relative to the other. Renault rises in the ranks by virtue of his connection to Belvidera, which also brings him one degree closer to her “Servants”. Pierre surpasses him — despite having no direct connection to Belvidera — by adding connections to Antonio, Aquilina (who shortens his distance to her “Maid”), the “Father”, the “Officer”, Priuli (who shortens his distance to Belvidera’s “Maid 2”), and the “Senators”. These details are about the math behind Figure 5, but they are also about the social boundaries of the play, and the role of clustering in identifying social groups.</Text>

            <Title>B isolated - compare Grecian D</Title>
            <Text>Belvidera, in contrast, is less central than “Officer” and even “Officer 2,” and less central than any of the conspirators— far from matching Hamlet as a protagonist, she is the second-most-marginalized named character, her 1.96 degrees of separation only barely beating out Aquilina’s 2.11. Here it may be instructive to introduce a comparison to a she-tragedy heroine whose status is not in dispute. I modelled Arthur Murphy’s 1772 drama The Grecian Daughter by the same methods as Venice Preserv’d, to examine Euphrasia as the sort of heroine for which Belvidera may be an ancestor. The Grecian Daugher has a smaller cast than Venice Preserv’d, and presents a much smaller and tighter network, so Figure 5 presents them at the same scale as a general indication of their relationship. Figure 6 allows us to examine The Grecian Daughter directly. Euphrasia is visibly central to several orderly, symmetrical groupings — Melanthon/Phocion/Evander/Euphrasia, for example, or Philotas/Melanthon/Euphrasia. What is not at all balanced is the Dionysius/Euphrasia/Evander triad, which, despite the fact that the conflict is ostensibly between Dionysius and Evander’s crown, clearly favours the two axes of relationship that feature Euphrasia. This contrast highlights how, even at first glance, Belvidera remains far from the bulk of the play, with a small number of strong connections rather than the wide-ranging web which involves Euphrasia in all aspects of her play’s plot.</Text>

            <Title>Cohesion: Aquilina</Title>
            <Text>Tied to centrality, but not synonymous with it, is a character’s role in the the structural stability of the network. Stability is a feature that is visible only once we take advantage of the nature of the model as a theoretical construct, and begin to intervene in the system that it represents. In the case of Moretti’s investigation of Hamlet, this meant removing various characters to see the negative image of their roles in the social cohesion of the play’s world. Removing Hamlet from the play’s network fragments it dramatically, Moretti finds, but removing Claudius has little impact. The difference has to do with clustering: an aera of a network is highly-clustered when the odds are high that two people who share a social tie have the same mutual acquaintances. Claudius is at the heart of a highly-clustered part of the network: he knows Polonius and Ophelia, and they know each other, and they also both know Claudius’s other connections. Removing Claudius does not remove Gertrude’s connection to Hamlet or even to Laertes. Hamlet’s social world is less clustered: Laertes doesn’t know the Gravedigger, and neither of them knows Horatio. Horatio, in fact, turns out to be the second-most structurally critical member of the play, after Hamlet himself, serving as the crucial connector for many non-clustered social ties. Moretti maps these highly-clustered and low-clustered areas to the ideas of “court” (in which governance is familial) and “state” (in which governance is bureaucratic), but this interpretation translate less neatly to Venice Preserv’d. The variation in clustering in Venice Preserv’d— as rendered visible by the relative density of names in various parts of the network map— seems to suggest, not two social orders, but one largely messy dominant group, and a smaller, isolated offshoot. </Text>

            <Title>Is this a she-tragedy?</Title>
            <Text>Thomas Otway’s Venice Preserv’d is often read as a play of competing value systems failing to achieve victory; this form of enacted social debate is, in many ways, the form of tragedy itself, but it is reinforced in a transitional play that is also in conflict with its own genre, neither fully a pathetic tragedy nor a she-tragedy. Jean Marsden, like many others, ends her list of authors of seventeenth century she-tragedies by noting that “a case can also be made for including Thomas Otway on this list” (65), but it is more usually Otway’s The Orphan whose heroine attracts attention. Nonetheless, Belvidera’s affective spectacle has prompted a complex debate about the gendered politics of the play. Rogers and Gruber both read the play’s central conflict as one of masculine versus feminine, but draw different conclusions from what they see as the ultimate defeat of the feminine. Rogers argues that, despite the homosocial focus of the plot, Otway expresses a “confidence in feminine values” and “affirms their validity in balance with masculine ones” (391), turning the audience’s tears at Belvidera’s death into a lesson about Belvidera’s value. Gruber, in contrast, sees no such development of Belvidera as an individual, and argues that the defeat of the feminine is displayed for prurient enjoyment by an unproblematically masculinized audience. To further explore Belvidera’s role in the overall structure of the plot, I have turned my attention to the social relations staged in the play. Agency, at its core, requires the ability to act upon the world; particularly at issue in this play, which is so attuned to shifting personal allegiances, is the ability to act upon a social world. Belvidera’s individual conversations are often highly successful in the short term, but unsuccessful in the broader context of the play: for Rogers this might mean that Belvidera’s approach is valuable but incompatible with a hostile masculine world; for Gruber, that Belvidera’s agency was illusionary in the first place. Despite Belvidera’s obvious importance to the play’s impact as a transitional she-tragedy, I argue that Gruber is correct: the play creates a world in which Belvidera’s personhood is consistently marginalized.</Text>

            <Title>homos!! and the duke apparently</Title>
            <Text>As Figure 4 shows, Venice Preserv’d is less straightforward than Hamlet: Jaffeir, Pierre, and the Duke all have identical levels of centrality. Each character directly addresses or is addressed by 20 of the 28 other characters in the play, standing at an average of 1.32 degrees of separation from each member of the network. Jaffeir’s place on this list does not upset any expectations. Nor does it disrupt our understanding of the play to see Pierre included, given the critical work on Pierre and Jaffeir’s homosocial bond as the heart of the play. But to have this pair placed on equal footing not with Belvidera, but with the Duke, who doesn’t even have a first name: this calls for closer examination. He may have less to say to each of his connections, but his authority to summon the conspirators for judgment represents significant power. His individual lines, too, follow a conversational pattern reflective of his authority: he is in the position to demand briefly that characters speak, and to receive at length their explanations of themselves. This sets him apart from both Pierre and Renault, who expend lengthy passages of persuasion to drive their conspiracy. Bedamar, the initial leader of the conspiracy, at many points follows the same pattern as the Duke, initiating conversations that are inequitable in his favour, but the Duke’s much lower degrees of separation indicates that he has had a much higher rate of success in having his authority recognized across the play’s social network.</Text>

            <Title>removing Aquilina fractures network</Title>
            <Text>To investigate the stability of the social network, the publication history of Venice Preserv’d happens to provide us with a ready-made experiment: later stagings and printings of the play often excised the “Nicky-Nacky” scenes, which also had the effect of removing Aquilina from the social network of the play. Figure 9 shows the structure of an 1847 American edition of the play, “correctly given, as performed at the Theatres Royal,” which not only cuts the offending scenes, but also shortens many lines and conversations throughout the play. These alterations are worthy of close-reading in their content: many of Belvidera’s lines, for example, appear to have been censored for sensuality,  an editorial decision that supports those critical readings which see Belvidera as defined by her sexual desire. At the scale of the plot, these changes draw our attention to different elements of the play. Munns’ introduction to the Broadview text suggests that the Nicky-Nacky scenes were cut for being “pointless” in addiction to obscene (381), but the shape of the play’s social network changes remarkably without them: now we see something a bit less muddled, where Jaffeir, in the centre, is torn between his ties to Pierre and to Belvidera, each of whom brings connections to a largely-distinct social world. Without Aquilina, it is much easier to frame the play in terms of the “stable series of binary oppositions” that Marsden sees as defining she-tragedy (63).</Text>
            <Comments>When Jaffeir offers to stab Belvidera, for example, as fulfillment of his promise that she would die if he betrayed the conspiracy, the 1847 text has Belvidera simply say “Now then, kill me” (n. pag), cutting the lines which follow in the 1682 edition, “While thus I cling about thy cruel neck,/ Kiss thy revengeful lips and die in joys/ Greater than any I can guess hereafter” (IV.ii.473-5).</Comments>

            <Title>the whole network is implicated</Title>
            <Text>To rephrase in positive terms: because Aquilina is present, the play’s social world is one interconnected unit. Aquilina’s role as a ‘public woman’ means that she circulates between men who otherwise have nothing in common, and it is her public reputation that spares from the consequences of harboring conspirators, when she is known and recognized by the Duke and even by the nameless “Senator” after Antonio’s speech on her behalf. Aquilina’s centrality to the cohesion of the play accords with Laura Rosenthal’s argument that the figure of the prostitute had become central to — though also indicative to problems with — the modern social order as it was understood. Because she underpins the play’s structure, both the senate and the conspirators are implicated in the free-floating sexual and financial corruption. Any social ills which the play might criticize, then, aren’t isolated to one part of the network — impeding attempts to draw clear boundaries around the targests of that criticism.</Text>

            <Title>None of these: Belvidera</Title>
            <Text>Belvidera and Aquilina look, at first, to be in highly similar positions on the margins of the social world, connected only to servants and to two men who vie for their allegiance. However, their impact on the structural cohesion of the network couldn’t be more different: despite the fact that Belvidera is directly connected to five characters and Aquilina only three, Aquilina’s removal splits the play network in two, and Belvidera’s affects only the small Belvidera-Priuli-Jaffeir triangle. In an otherwise unbalanced, diffuse structure, Belvidera is part of one of the only clusters: everybody she knows also knows most of her acquaintances. Her presence in the cluster could be a measure of importance, as it is for Claudius in Hamlet, but it could just as easily be a measure of some superfluity, as it is for Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Indeed, none of the measures of network importance considered here — the region of death, the measures of centrality, experiments in cohesion — make a case for Belvidera as a heroine. However, given her enormous impact on audiences, her lack of importance in the network suggests not that she is unimportant, but that her importance is located outside the social exchanges of her fictional world. Her second-strongest tie after Jaffeir is to her own soliloquies: these speeches may be unable to reach her fellow inhabitants of the play, but that does not mean they are entirely unheard.</Text>

            <Text>Similarly, then, the audience’s position within the senate’s diffuse part of the social network may be the strongest indication that Venice Preserv’d attempts to endorse a side. Renault and Antonio soliloquize their morally dubious opinions, but Priuli, Belvidera, and Jaffeir all provide emotional interpretations of conversations and events that invite audience solutions. And here, at last, Belvidera stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Jaffeir: of the 198 lines addressed to the audience, Jaffeir speaks 69 of them, and Belvidera 55. Pierre speaks none. However much Belvidera may lack an audience within her own fictive world, she has one outside it. Thus, it is in her soliloquies and especially her asides that Belvidera most resembles the she-tragedy heroine Euphrasia. If Venice Preserv’d is a transitional she-tragedy, then, it marks a stage where our heroine has been introduced, but we are as yet the only ones who are able to hear her.</Text>

I'l heal its failings, and deserve thy Love.

            <Text>The math, as indicated in Figure 7, largely supports this assessment. Euphrasia turns out to come second to Dionysius, who accomplishes an average 1.24 degrees of separation by monopolizing his own court. There are four roles who connect to no one but Dionysius: “Herald,” “Officer,” “Officers,” and Perdiccas. Two others, “Greek Officer” and “Greek Officers,” link only to Dionysius and his officer Melanthon. But Euphrasia, at 1.35 average degrees of separation, addresses or is addressed by all 13 of the remaining roles, including several whom Dionysius does not address. It is because her strategies succeed that Dionysius has no chance to speak to Phocion, or to her “Female Attendants.” Perhaps surprisingly, even Arcas, who began the play as one of Dionysius’s soldiers, never comes in contact with Dionysius, thanks to Euphrasia’s speedy subornment. All of these relations place Euphrasia in a position of power within the play, able to draw on a wide range of resources, and even able usurp Dionysius’s own social connections away from him. To see Belvidera ranked between Theodore and “Father,” then, calls into serious question Belvidera’s status as a heroine in Euphrasia’s mode.</Text>

“Making the past just as visible as the present: that is one major change introduced by the use of networks. Then, they make visible specific “regions” within the plot as a whole: sub- systems, that share some significant property. “ (4)
“Take the characters who are connected to both Claudius and Hamlet in Figure 5: except for Osric and Horatio, whose link to Claudius is however extremely tenuous, they are all killed. Killed by whom, is not always easy to say: Polonius is killed by Hamlet, for instance – but Hamlet has no idea that it is Polonius he is stabbing behind the arras; Gertrude is killed by Claudius – but with poison prepared for Hamlet, not for her; Hamlet is killed by Laertes, with Claudius’s help, while Laertes himself, like Rosencrantz and Guildenstern before him, are all killed by Hamlet, but with Claudius’s weapons. Individual agency is muddled; what is truly deadly, is the characters’ position in the network, chained to the warring poles of king and prince. Outside of that red region, no one dies in Hamlet. The tragedy, is all there.” (4)
“Why is the protagonist significant here? Not for what is “in” it; not for its essence, but for its function in the stability of the network. And stability has clearly much to do with centrality, but is not identical to it. Take the second most central character of the play: Claudius. In quantitative terms, Claudius is almost as central as Hamlet (average distance of 1.62, ver- sus 1.45); but in structural terms not so, when we remove him from the network (Figures 14-5) what happens is that a handful of peripheral characters are affected, but the network as a whole not much. Even if we remove, first Hamlet, and then Claudius (Figures 16-8), his subtraction doesn’t do much. But if we remove, first Hamlet, and then Horatio (Figures 19-21), then the fragmentation is so radical that the Ghost and Fortinbras – which is to say, the beginning and the ending of the play – are completely severed from each other and from the rest of the plot. Hamlet no longer exists. And yet, Horatio is slightly less central than Claudius in quantitative terms (1.69 versus 1.62). Why is he so much more important in structural terms?” (5)

            <Text>Rogers’ 1985 article makes the case that Otway’s Venice Preserv’d expresses a “confidence in feminine values” and “affirms their validity in balance with masculine ones” (391); this general stance is used in 2007/8 to argue against Elizabeth Gruber’s conclusion that Otway uses his female protagonist only to “display her victimization” (197). The 2007/8 article insists in positive terms that “Belvidera is an active agent” (198), extending Rogers’ 1985 argument that Belvidera presents her feminine worldview in a way that can “command respect” (395). More generally, the 1985 article departs from a tradition of detailed historicist investigation of eighteenth century Whigs and Tories, and instead reads the play as, at its core, a conflict between masculine and feminine values.
Rogers’ articles thus provides the stakes for my examination of the play’s plot. I remain unpersuaded by Gruber’s dismissal of Belvidera (and her insistence that the play is a rewriting of Othello), but also find myself disagreeing with Rogers’ assessment of the play’s structure. According to Moretti’s network-mapping definition, Belvidera is not the protagonist of the play. Moreover, although Jaffeir is certainly torn between her and Pierre, Belvidera’s side of the social world is nearly empty— by no means well-balanced against Pierre’s male sphere. Several of the details of her reading, however, point to other ways to understand Belvidera’s importance; I will examine these more closely as I explore the idea that, despite her lack of broader social support, Belvidera represents a serious challenge to Jaffeir’s bond with Pierre.</Text>

Delicately Corrected and Constantly Befriended:
Arthur Murphy’s Female Characters
Barbara Mackey King


Of all Murphy’s tragic heroines, Euphrasia, the heroine of The Grecian Daughter (1769/1772)31 has to be the one the most constantly befriended. First, Euphrasia drives the plot, being onstage close to two-thirds of the time. Murphy’s four tragedies all deal with tyrannical usurpation; however, in this play it is the aging king’s daughter who takes premeditated action to solve the dilemma. Her most memorable action appears in Act II where she gains entrance to see her father, sentenced to starve to death in a cave, and she nurses him with her own infant’s milk. Looking in the (offstage) cave, the guard see her and says:
O! I can hold no more; at such a sight Ev’n the hard heart of tyranny would melt To infant softness […] [End Page 203]
Behold that unexampled goodness; see Th’expedient sharp necessity has taught her; The father foster’d at his daughter’s breast! O! filial piety! — the milk design’d For her own offspring, on the parent’s lip Allays the parching fever.32
She takes decisive means to save her kingdom, not only by suckling her father, but also by convincing the guards to assist her by acting as spies in the tyrant’s court. She watches the progress of the battles with rapt attention, shouting in victory as she sees rival soldiers perish in the sea. She taunts the usurper to his face without backing down, and finally, she stabs him in his heart with as much firmness as any masculine hero, gloating over the blood on her dagger’s point. The play ends with the restored king giving his crown, not to Euphrasia’s husband, who is fighting in the army, but to Euphrasia herself, saying that he hopes that she may become “A parent to her people.”33
Like Murphy’s three previous tragic heroines,34 Euphrasia does not fit the classic mould of the Shakespearean or Aristotelian tragic heroes, but rather, follows the example of Dryden’s heroic plays which typically contain exemplary characters as moral paradigms for the audience to follow. Thus Euphrasia is the embodiment of what it means to be the perfect daughter. It is clear that Murphy’s eighteenth century audience caught this message, since The Critical Review for March, 1772, reported that spectators were more interested in the relationship between father and daughter than in the theme of tyrannical usurpation:
The fate of Evander and Euphrasia interests us through the whole play[…]. The incident on which this tragedy is founded35 is one of the most singular examples of filial affection that we meet with in all history, and the author has improved it with all the lively force of description that words can possibly convey.36
Euphrasia not only drives the plot, but presents a remarkably rounded character by portraying different aspects of her personality to different people. She is heroically strong and militant to the invaders, tender and loving to her family, reverent to the gods, and in despair when falsely told her father has been executed. Her masterful persuasion in the scene in Act II in which she begs the guard to allow her to see her father, covers five pages of text, and illustrates a wide variety of moods and approaches. First she begs the guard, throwing herself at his feet, and when that is unsuccessful, [End Page 204] she tries a patriotic plea: “Thou, like me,/ Wert born in Greece.” Next she appeals to his filial sense: “You have a father, too.” After that she raves in excess: “Here will I dwell, and rave, and shriek, and give/ These scattered locks to all the passing winds.” She finally succeeds by shaming the guard’s manhood. When he says he dare not let her see her father or else he will be punished, she replies:
And if you dare!—Is that The voice of manhood? Honest, if you dare! ‘Tis the slave’s virtue! ‘tis the utmost limit Of the base coward’s honour.37
This ploy succeeds; the guard leaves the tyrant and, as one of Euphrasia’s followers, becomes a spy in the enemy’s camp.
When David Garrick first read the manuscript, he exclaimed, “The part of the daughter is one of the finest for an actress in all the dramatic circle.”38 According to Dunbar, the opening night reviews were “rapturous […]. The enthusiastic approval of The Grecian Daughter […] was almost wholly free from adverse comments.”39 Mrs. Thrale held it to be her favorite tragedy, and she wrote in her journal for March/April 1778: “Mr. Murphy’s Grecian Daughter [sic] is I think unquestionably the best of all our modern tragedies, and all its merit is the power it has over our passions.”40 The Grecian Daughter outshone all other tragedies of the period and held the boards for seven decades,41 continuing in stock until 1848.42 Only four other tragedies were acted more frequently—Hamlet, Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet, and Jane Shore.43 The role of Euphrasia was Sarah Siddons’ favorite role and the one she used as her farewell piece.44 As late as 1831, the role of Euphrasia was one young actresses felt they had to perform in order to establish their reputations,45 much as young men today still feel they must perform Hamlet. As Murphy wrote his four tragedies, the role of the tragic heroine grew in length and plot significance in each succeeding play. Euphrasia, Murphy’s ultimate tragic woman, is strong minded, action taking, multi-dimensional, and morally exemplary.</Text>

            <Text>Unlike Pierre, who would seem to be the obvious moral danger, Renault has no redemptive heroic philosophy, and does not escape the ignominy of state execution. Characters die in order according to the strength of their ties to Renault: the conspirators in a mass, Pierre and then Jaffeir together in succession, and then at the end, when we think perhaps she might escape, their dialogue-tenuous but plot-intense connection pulls Belvidera into the grave. Renault is at the centre of the corrupting part of the plot: he enters the play soliloquizing about the short-sightedness of his own ambition (II.iii.1-7), and right away quarrels with Eliot and then with Bedamar. He also, from the first, challenges Bedamar’s authority as the leader of the conspiracy. When Bedamar attempts to resolve Renault’s conflict with Eliot, Renault offers violence to one of them— the stage directions do not specify, but it is Bedamar who rebukes him with, “Renault, thy hand!” (II.iii.38)— and Bedamar must pressure Eliot to be the one to stand down from the conflict that Renault initiated. More subtly, when Bedamar is consolidating the conspirators’ loyalty, extracting from them the group cry of “All! We’ll die with Bedamore” (II.iii.76), Renault cuts in to give his own rousing speech. By the time the conspiracy itself takes shape, in Act III, Bedamar is no longer present with the conspirators, and Renault appears to have quietly usurped his place. Renault, like Bedamar, makes large speeches to the assembled group, which demand affirmations of their loyalty in return, but Renault’s talk betrays a disproportionate thirst for violence that horrifies Jaffeir. Renault’s overreaching— both in the bloodthirstiness of his conspiracy, and in his unseen overthrow of Bedamar— appears to be the crucial flaw that dooms all those who associate with him.</Text>

            <Text>JEAN I. MARSDEN. Fatal Desire: Women, Sexuality, and the English Stage, 1660-1720. Ithaca: Cornell, 2006. Pp. 216. $45.
In Fatal Desire, Ms. Marsden traces the critical role women played in late seventeenth/early eighteenth-century English theater as playwrights, actors, and spectators. The "she-tragedy," which she defines as a subgenre that "focuses on the suffering and often tragic end of a central, female figure," became the form playwrights used to invoke an emotional response and to forward a political agenda. As the political message became prioritized over female sexuality, the popularity of the "shetragedy" came to a close; this indicated the important role the genre played in satisfying the audience's desire for the "spectacle of female distress."
Ms. Marsden discusses the turn-of-the-century theatrical debates, best characterized by the writings of Collier, and the roles women played as both object within the plays and subject within the audience. While anti-theater texts like Collier's feared female subjects because they could embody unchecked sexual desire, women were at least acknowledged. Next she explores the representation of female sexuality in Wycherley's The Plain Dealer (1676/77) and Vanbrugh's The Provok'd Wife (1697). In The Plain Dealer the mask of false modesty only serves to cover up wanton female desire, while in The Provok'd Wife, a sympathetic female character's unhappy marriage serves as a justification for contemplating acting on unfulfilled sexual desire.
Beginning in the 1680s, the authors of "she-tragedy" were most interested in exploring the pathos behind female spectacle and sexual titillation. Authors such as Southerne (The Fatal Marriage, 1694) and Congreve (The Mourning Bride, 1697) successfully combined sexuality and suffering, the end result being a universal appeal to both men and women. "She-tragedies" began to take on a political function in society, as they reinforced the importance of a stable British nation that hinged upon controlling female sexuality and virtue.
Plays by Pix, Trotter, and Manley demonstrate a diversity of thought about the position of women. Pix's Ibrahim, the Thirteenth Emperour of the Turks (1696) most clearly imitates the "shetragedies" written by her male counterparts, while Trotter moves away from the conventions and presents women who are in control of their sexuality. Manley makes an even more decisive protofeminist move by never staging female distress; instead she makes men the subject of the sexual gaze.
With the image of Queen Anne as a powerful female ruler, playwrights began contriving their tragedies with the more political intention of promoting a national virtue. This coincided with a dip in the number of new "she-tragedies" written. One playwright who did remain active during the first part of the century was Rowe; his Fair Penitent (1703) and Tragedy of Jane Shore (1714) were focused on the implications of a woman's lost sexual purity. Rowe connected women's and England's virtue, placing the responsibility for the purity of the nation in the hands of women, whose chastity gained symbolic status. The link between female sexual purity and national purity culminates in Rowe's Tragedy of Lady Jane Gray (1715), where the woman as symbol and object become conflated. Expecting sexual titillation, the audience was disappointed by Rowe's political emphasis. This illustrates, Ms. Marsden argues, that the heroine in the "she-tragedy" was always interpreted as a sexualized object.
Ms. Marsden's text studies the often ignored genre of "she-tragedy," and her readings of the female body as subject and object adds to theater and gender criticism. She claims that "femalecentered tragedies . . . dominated the stage at the very end of the century." The period is well known for the plethora of comedies, and more evidence is needed for the popularity of these tragedies. Overall, however, Ms. Marsden fascinatingly explores the social and political implications of women in the tragedies of the period.

            <Title>wikipedia on she-tragedy</Title>
            <Text>When English drama was reborn in 1660 with the re-opening of the theatres, the leading tragic style was the male-dominated heroic dramawhich celebrated powerful, aggressively masculine heroes and their pursuit of glory, as rulers and conquerors as well as lovers. In the 1670s and 1680s, a gradual shift occurred from heroic to pathetic tragedy, where the subject was love and domestic concerns, even though the main characters might be public figures. After the phenomenal success of Elizabeth Barry in moving the audience to tears in the role of Monimia in Otway's The Orphan, she-tragedy became the dominant form of pathetic tragedy and remained highly popular for nearly half a century.


She tragedies are known for having focused on the hardships of women rather than those suffered by men. A she-tragedy during the 1680s derived its power from the ability to create titillating scenes that portrayed the suffering of an innocent woman.[4] Pathetic tragedies would begin by presenting the heroine and establishing that she was desirable. Unlike the other popular new genre, horror, the she-tragedy did not depend on violence and gore to become the spectacle of the heroine but rather used the physical suffering that was inflicted on the blameless female victims.[5] The women, who were the subject of the play, would usually become victims of adversity and crimes that sexually exploited them such as rape or unsolicited adultery. During the scenes of rape the woman would be abducted and carried off stage. The act of rape, or adultery, would be conveyed to the audience by screams from the woman as the villain completed the evil deed. After the scene the woman would return onstage. Evidences of ravished womanhood such as disheveled hair, disordered clothing, and phallic dagger were trademark of Restoration rape and prominent in she-tragedy.[6] Playwrights would utilize other ill fortune such as the loss of a husband or child and a single mother's struggle to raise her children as another means of causing hardship in the heroine's life. After suffering these hardships throughout the play the female protagonist would be overcome by madness, commit suicide or murder as a result of the burden with which she had suffered.[7] The success of a she-tragedy was dependent upon the emotion that the actress conveyed to the audience, but the emotion that the audience felt as they watched the performance. She-tragedy also focused on making the heroine and not the hero the focus of the play. Attention would be placed on the female actress and her sexuality as playwrights used specific dialogue and devices to focus on the sexuality of the woman. One example of this is seen in The Orphan by Otway. In a scene Monimia is accompanied by a page who states to her "Madam, Indeed I'd serve you with my soul; But n the morning when you call me to you As by your bed I stand and tell you stories, I am asham'd to see your swelling Breasts, It makes me blush, they are so very white." (1.221-25) Here Otway is directing the audience's eyes to the actress' breasts, making her the focal point, and also sexualizing the actress and the character of Monima.[8]</Text>

            <Title>Marsden review 2</Title>
            <Text>This fine book adds to an ever-increasing number of revisionist accounts of Restoration and eighteenth-century theater. While Restoration drama has not lacked sophisticated and admiring critics, the gloomy sense of contemporaries that the late Stuart and Georgian stages were scenes of declining literary accomplishment has only been reinforced by two hundred years of largely negative scholarly and critical assessment. Theater historians were aware that the stage was continuously popular in this period but the meticulous mapping of plays, performers, and performances by the formidably industrious and learned likes of Allardyce Nicoll and Robert Hume has not been matched by admiring explanations of the drama's appeal. Until very recently, the most ambitious engagements with eighteenth-century theatrical discourse came from Richard Sennett, David Marshall, and Jean Christophe Agnew, whose focus on the pervasiveness of performative tropes in figuring identity in the period, whether demotically, philosophically, or socially, is accompanied by a dismissal of the theater itself as an ineffective institution for negotiating the novel modes of selfhood produced by commercial society.
Beginning in the 1990s, however, with the emergence of cultural history as a dominant mode of humanist enquiry, a "reviv'd" eighteenth-century theater studies has been "lifting up its head," as Dryden put it. Kristina Straub's Sexual Suspects: Eighteenth-Century Players and Sexual Ideology (1992), Kathleen Wilson's The Sense of the People (1995), and Christine Gerrard's The Patriot Opposition to Walpole (1994) all broke new ground by treating Georgian theater and theatrical texts as important sites of cultural innovation, crucial in [End Page 386] generating, circulating, and contesting new gender, class, national, and imperial identities. Other revisionist accounts—which eschew the hitherto routine acknowledgement of their objects' aesthetic shortcomings—include Felicity Nussbaum's The Limits of the Human (2003), John O'Brien'sHarlequin Britain (2005), and Daniel O'Quinn's Staging Governance: Theatrical Imperialism in London, 1770–1800. The most ambitious and wide-reaching of these studies is Lisa Freeman's Character's Theater: Genre and Identity on the Eighteenth-Century English Stage (2002), which tackles the marginalization of the theater head-on, arguing that the importance accorded to the novel in traditional literary history has blinded us to the stage's ability to model "character" understood as a contextually generated series of surfaces that served as a complement to the contemporaneous emergence of the novelistic subject, characterized by deep interiority.
Jean Marsden's book thus enters a field where the bar has been raised considerably in the last few years. Unlike most of the authors cited above, however, she is particularly concerned with the serious drama produced in the last decade of the seventeenth and the first twenty years of the eighteenth century, focusing on the neglected but theatrically dominant mode of she-tragedy (a tag coined by Rowe, arguably its greatest exponent). Although the intensely partisan politics of these years are not neglected—notably in the last chapter on The Tragedy of Lady Jane Grey (1715)—this book is primarily a feminist analysis of the ideological implications of she-tragedy's rise. Starting from the introduction of female players in the early Restoration, the book analyzes the cultural anxieties generated by the sexualized spectacle of women onstage. Weaving deftly between recent feminist film theory and late Stuart writings on the theater, Marsden emphasizes the ways in which the erotic satisfaction afforded male viewers also produced fears that women spectators might be infected by and act upon the transgressive female desire depicted in the theater. Her astute and persuasive re-readings of Collier and Dennis prepare for a chapter focused on female spectatorship in Wycherley's The Plain Dealer (1676/77) and Vanbrugh's The Provok'd Wife (1697). In the first comedy, Marsden identifies a paradig-matically misogynist structure of characterization that suggests sexually active women will be punished for their attempted usurpation of masculine prerogatives while the conventionally passive (and sexually spectacularized) female is rewarded. In the post-'88 world of The Provok'd Wife, however, Marsden identifies a new concern and sympathy for women conscious that their selfhood must be construed in terms of masculine desire and trapped by apparently immutable contracts in positions of humiliating subordination.
Turning to she-tragedy proper, Marsden sets out the semiotics of a form defined by the suffering of defiled objects of desire. Emphasizing that the [End Page 387]pleasure generated by these plays was voyeuristic and scopophilic, readings of Southerne's The Fatal Marriage and Congreve's The Mourning Bride suggest that their particular "technology of gender" was adaptable to diverse party-political ends, working primarily to reinforce existing social structures of sexual power. Marsden further argues that the obsession with the regulation of female sexuality legible in these plays was informed by the contemporary presumption that both national and imperial order was dependent on the chastity of British womanhood. Turning next to the way in which female dramatists revised she-tragedy, Marsden refutes the widespread assumption that the female wits accepted an identification of female authorship with prostitution, emphasizing instead that they figured themselves within the literary sphere in virtuous terms, as women warriors or helpless damsels. Their very different tragic productions also varied from celebrations of chaste female friendship (in Catherine Trotter's very proper plays), through Mary Pix's recuperation of raped heroines to Delariviere Manley's challenging depiction of women as sexual subjects.
The book's final two chapters are concerned primarily with Rowe and the later she-tragedians. In detailed and persuasive readings of Ambrose Phillips's The Distrest Mother (1712) and Rowe's The Fair Penitent (1703), and The Tragedy of Jane Shore (1714), Marsden shows how an intensely moralized display of feminine suffering replaces the spectacular sexual violence of the earlier plays, as dramatists try to produce chaster and more ethically illustrative heroines. This emphasis on didacticism informs the choice of domestic or national themes, in which the fate of the English nation is shown to depend, in newly literal terms, on the virtue of female protagonists such as Lady Jane Grey.
The book is everywhere persuasive in its fluent, learned, and lucid readings of particular texts and its broader claim that the she-tragedy should be central to our understanding of theatrical culture and gender ideology in the late Restoration and early eighteenth century. Fatal Desire will prove an indispensable part of the revised account of drama in this period. My only caveats concern the modesty of Marsden's claims, given the very suggestive implications of her study for accounts of the development of sentimental discourse, later eighteenth-century serious drama, and the novelistic subject. As Laura Brown pointed out some years ago in English Dramatic Form, 1660–1760, the Richardsonian novel takes from she-tragedy the virtuous, suffering heroine whose travails are designed to produce a morally instructive identification on the part of readers. This dependence on feminocentric pathos in both genres problematizes the sharp distinction between them, suggesting a longer, more theatrical backstory for accounts of the rise of the novelistic subject. Equally suggestive, given Lynn Festa's recent claim that sentimentality was the paradigmatic mode of eighteenth-century discourse (Sentimental Figures of Empire in Eighteenth-Century Britain and France), is the she-tragedy's frequent recourse [End Page 388] to specifically national subjects. Finally, the critical recovery of female Romantic dramatists in recent years has emphasized the novelty of their stress on private, domestic, and feminine experience. Marsden's invaluable account should remind us that such depictions of female suffering and virtue were pervasive, not just in the three decades of their emergence but in frequent revivals throughout the century. Now the backstory familiar to Elizabeth Inchbald, Hannah More, and Joanna Baillie is available to all of us.</Text>

            <Title>abstract</Title>
            <Text>Nicholas Rowe coined the term “she-tragedy” in 1714 to refer to a recently successful kind of tragedy, which takes advantage of the still-new presence of actresses on the Restoration stage to present spectables of female suffering. She-tragedies took pathetic tragedy to its logical extreme, and were extremely different from the heroic dramas that pre-dated them. The characteristic marginalization-yet-theatrical-power is captured in the dynamics of the play’s social network, as the heroines speak at great length but to few people and little effect, in contrast to the debates and wide-ranging social circulation of the central male figures in heroic dramas. The most mesmerizing she-tragedy heroines instead speak directly to their audiences. As theatrical tastes shift toward bourgeois drama, it seems as if women remain marginalized through their continued alliance with the domestic, but in fact a shift occurs in the amount of agency they are able to show. As the mere presence of an actress on the stage becomes more familiar, the theatrical/social activities of heroines and heroes become more similar. 
Can I tell which plays were less impressive as she-tragedies because their heroines speak less to the audience?
My article is about how and why the heroines of tragedies went from being socially proscribed to occupying the same structural plot roles as male heroes of tragedies over the course of the long 18th century.
Something about the shift from heroic drama to pathetic tragedy and back again? My argument may be that, when theatrical tastes shift away from pathetic tragedy and toward bourgeois drama, this doesn’t look like a change in women’s status on the stage, but it actually is, because they get more agency.
But I need way more proof than I have for those claims.
What I’ve actually shown is that my social networks can detect the difference between a heroic drama and a pathetic tragedy. Agency and speech are intimately connected in plays (as makes sense). Although she-tragedy heroines are marginalized in the world of their plays, they make direct claims on the audience’s sympathy; they are distinct from the heroic drama before and the bourgeois drama after in their attempt to speak directly out from the stage.

Venice Preserv’d (1682), The Grecian Daughter (1772)

I think my new argument is that, when women are first introduced to tragedies their mere spectacular presence is sufficient to make an enormous impression on the audience — but as the genre of she-tragedy is established, the heroines become more similar to the male heroes they displace.

            <Title>methodology: model social networks</Title>
            <Text>In investigating social relationships, I am interested in speech as an act in itself, as discussed in J. L. Austin’s How To Do Things With Words: any utterance, he argues, is in some sense an attempt to perform some effect upon the world. Just as attempted acts of other kinds carry weight beyond their content, agency and power relations shape not just what people say to each other, but who speaks to whom in the first place, and how much they say. However, these complex relationships require abstraction in order to be perceived in their entirety; accordingly, to take in these social structures as a whole, I have turned to digital methods, and visualized the characters’ verbal interactions as a network map (Figure 1). Working from the Gutenberg and Early English Books Online digital texts for technical ease, checking against my print copy for accuracy, I encoded the speakers, addressees, and numbers of lines into a spreadsheet by hand. Then I used the visualization software Gephi to convert these individual vectors to a full network map. The resulting map, like a complex passage in a work of literature, is not easily apprehended at first glance and requires close reading. Importantly, however, what is being close read is no longer Venice Preserv’d in itself: Franco Moretti, my predecessor in this enterprise, correctly notes that “once you make a network of a play, you stop working on the play proper, and work on a model instead” (5). A model, as Willard McCarty suggests, intentionally compresses or elides many details of an object in order to render visible a different set of underlying details or structures. In this instance, to map Venice Preserv’d as a social network models the play itself as a set of interactions between characters, with the most salient features being length, direction, and frequency of address. This method seeks to see speech not as linguistic content, but as a social action. In the image, these speech acts are represented by curved lines. Each speech act is represented as one light gray curve; the width of the curve reflects the length of the speech. If one character speaks to another repeatedly, these gray curves will layer over each other and thicken to approach black. Two characters who speak to each other reciprocally will be joined by two curves, as in the Jaffeir-Belvidera relationship. This lets us see, for example, that Belvidera and Priuli’s “Servants,” unlike the “Officer,” are not permitted to speak back to those giving them their orders. The network also shows both Belvidera and Jaffeir speaking more, and longer, to Priuli than they are spoken to, a relationship perhaps more likely to be less readily apparent in the full script of the play. Implicit in my reading of this model is the assumption that the ability to speak requires some level of social agency. Some speech acts will accomplish their goals and some will not— fates which are not visualized here— but all attempts require that the words have someone to act upon.</Text>

            <Title>Marsden review 3</Title>
            <Text>Focusing on the genre of “she-tragedy,” Jean Marsden’s book offers an account of why the British theater of the Restoration and early eighteenth century fixated on the suffering woman as a figure of arousal, sympathy, or condemnation—often, seemingly, all at once. Fatal Desireably addresses vital theatrical developments during decades typically identified with rakish comedy and heroic tragedy, foregrounding the instrumentality of pathos and the centrality of women to provide a salutary corrective.
Fatal Desire begins by situating the 60 years of the subtitle as a period during which onstage women and the emotional effects they raised in their audiences became a “source of cultural anxiety” (5), imperiling both sexual and national virtues. Tracing the Collier controversy over stage profanity and obscenity, Marsden finds unease over moral contagion spreading from lewd play-action to impressionable audiences, principally female spectators. Anti-theatrical polemicists may have found the female gaze threatening—but at least they forthrightly admit its power. In contrast, defenses of the stage by practitioners including Congreve and Vanbrugh consider female theatergoers moved only to decorous emulation, never to desire. Marsden perceives this as a telling overcompensation, evidence that prominent Restoration and early eighteenth-century playwrights disregarded the female gaze and accordingly relied upon voyeurism and objectification of women for their own works’ emotional and [End Page 57] political effects. Marsden subsequently uses comedy to calibrate a baseline for the “problem of the female gaze” (39) in the Restoration-era theater. While the comedies (like The Plain Dealer and The Provok’d Wife) stage characters who indulge their sexual appetites and seize control of the desiring gaze—in order to scapegoat them at worst or reform them at best—the tragedies reconfigure female agency so as to strip away the “aggressive sexuality” (61) and linger over the spectacle of the woman as victim.
Marsden’s four next chapters, the heart of her argument, are dedicated to what she dubs “female-centered tragedy.” She discusses in detail works by Otway (The Orphan), Southerne (The Fatal Marriage), and Congreve (The Mourning Bride); the “Female Wits” Trotter, Pix, and Manley; and Rowe (The Fair Penitent, Jane Shore, and Jane Gray). Marsden has read impressively widely in the mode, and her work draws on both the nearly-canonical and the ephemeral, anonymous, and scurrilous. Her admonition to continue narratives of British theatrical history past 1700 is especially well-taken. Fatal Desire extends the insights into the cultural work performed by Restoration and eighteenth-century tragedy offered most recently by Lisa Freeman’s Character’s Theater (2002), which in a key chapter argues that the era’s tragedies omit or contain female agency in order to promote nationalism and bourgeois values, and Cynthia Lowenthal’s Performing Identities on the Restoration Stage (2003), whose discussion of gender, exoticism, and tragedy traces the emergence of transgressive female heroism in the 1690s. Marsden aptly connects the pervasive dismissal of she-tragedy to a perception that its characteristic emotionalism is soft-hearted or girlish.
Yet this is not to say that Fatal Desire aims to rehabilitate the often-deprecated she-tragedy. Indeed for Marsden these plays become evidence of a widespread effort to shore up “the stability of English sexual and political culture” (63). In she-tragedy, disorderly women who bring categories into crisis are traded among and displayed by gazing men and finally must be terminated with extreme prejudice. Men are led to watch these tableaux of victimization, especially rape and incest, for vicarious sensual gratification or “visual pleasure”; women are led to sympathize, cry, and become tableaux in turn themselves, heroines becoming both “object of pity and object of desire” (76).
As a result, women who desire and women who have been desired are equally consigned to objectification, debasement, and destruction. Rape plots are sensational staples of the Restoration era, but many tragic women incur punishment for their strong and active passions. Isabella in The Fatal Marriage, whose unwitting adultery leads to her demise, speaks what becomes for Marsden a leitmotif of sorts for the first generation of she-tragedy: “Do! Nothing, no, for I am born to suffer.” Rowe’s works—the “second generation”—minimize the lurid quality of women’s sexual sins but not their contaminating effects. Women who “overstep the lines of acceptable behavior” (134)—even when they do not choose to; or actively choose not to; or do so unwillingly—must be eradicated. Calista in The Fair Penitent and Jane Shore are equally rendered exemplary victims, indelibly tainted by their sexual pasts, bereft of sexual agency and reduced to passivity and abjection.
In somewhat of a departure—but a welcome one—near the end Marsden turns to historicize the she-tragedy in the conventional sense, readingJane Gray as pro-Hanoverian [End Page 58] polemic. But Rowe’s virtuous heroine this time around was excessively passionless in her patriotism, incapable of supporting the requisite erotic interest of a viable she-tragedy, and consequently Jane Gray fails. An afterword contends that drama swung away from she-tragedy when “female sexuality became increasingly risky to stage” (192).
Marsden’s approach is indebted to the film studies of Laura Mulvey and Teresa de Lauretis, and the gaze remains the abiding category of analysis throughout Fatal Desire. Marsden’s emphasis on “sexual spectacle” leads her to conclude that the audience for she-tragedy is taught that victimized women get what they deserve—and that watching them, whether to cry or to leer, is a thrill. This commitment to sexual spectacle as the core of she-tragedy is both Fatal Desire’s distinctive contribution and its major constraint. In the epilogue to Jane Shore, where he coins the phrase “she-tragedy,” Rowe does not focus on sexual spectacle. There, Anne Oldfield, who had played Jane, enumerates women’s everyday vices as “ill-nature, pride, hypocrisy and gaming” and jokes that tragedies staging such qualities—to wit, “she-tragedies”— might “o’errun the nation.” At the inception of the expression, then, she-tragedy is not solely predicated upon sex. When a tragedy like Trotter’s Agnes de Castro or Rowe’s Jane Gray promotes a sexless, stoic idea of civic virtue, is it to challenge a predominant voyeuristic mode—or are these plays, too, mainstream she-tragedies by a different definition? Does all “visual pleasure” derive from objectification and disempowerment, or are there alternative conceptions of female spectacle and agency? Moreover, Helen Thompson’s Ingenuous Subjection (2005) and Scott Paul Gordon’sThe Power of the Passive Self (2002) argue against making resistance the touchstone for autonomy in the eighteenth century, especially for women. If quiescence is not necessarily complicity, a persecuted woman like the protagonists of she-tragedy might be more a martyr than an object of desire or scapegoat for cultural anxiety.
Nonetheless, Marsden should be commended for giving what amounts to the first fully-fledged account of she-tragedy: how it emerged, how it evolved, and the uses to which it was put. Fatal Desire is a searching and stimulating study that succeeds in shifting our own gaze to the period’s foremost theatrical concerns.</Text>

Veronica's telling: article doesn't know what it's big signifcant claim is just yet, but it has all its evidence; two plays that do two very different things with she-tragedy heroines, and both work but they occur on either side of a century -- my task is to find out how one turns into the other. 

tragic heroine played by an actual woman -- still had novelty
totally different experience for the audience, in post-rape scene with hair down and clothes torn; 
written specifically for Elizabeth Barry at the height of her fame

Cassandra figure -- no one believes her

Grecian Daughter maybe keyed to change in female protagonists in novels around 60s; a new burst of active female protagonists because passive heroines are boring

How long was Venice Preservd still staged?
Who played Euphrasia? Mrs Barry???

My article is about how and why the heroines of tragedies went from being socially proscribed to occupying the same structural plot roles as male heroes of tragedies over the course of the long 18th century.

Lawrence’s article uses (what will be) a formidable data set to think about the changes in the sociability and activity of the tragic heroine across the long 18th c.</Text>

            <Text>“The feminization of serious drama in this period is tied to the cultural function of theater. Because of women’s function as symbols of both domestic and imperial impropriety, any consideration of women in drama must link the representation of women on the stage to the social context in which they appeared and to the moral and often political lessons they presented to the men and women in the audience. These lessons are especially evident in the tragedies… the heroines of tragedy suffer for their sins, real or perceived. Their suffering serves the dual purpose of pleasing and educating the theater audience.” (14)

“Although the plays of this period are diverse in form… they are remarkably coherent in their obsession with portraying the woes of women, particularly those women who have, voluntarily or involuntarily, committed a sexual sin. In this way, they can be seen as an outgrowth of the pathetic plays of the 1680s, particularly those of Otway and Banks.” (62)
“She-tragedy reiterates gender as a stable series of binary oppositions: male/female, subject/object, and actor/acted upon, oppositions that supported rather than threatened existing social structures.” (63) “women accept rather than challenge their subordinate position within a patriarchal society, choosing… to suffer rather than to act.” (64)
“a case can also be made for including Thomas Otway on this list” (65)

in Venice Preserved “attempted rapes often demonstrate the moral degeneracy of those who seek to usurp power” (75)

“Belvidera’s anguish over her parting from Jaffeir drives her mad and ultimately results in he pathetic death.” (90)

“through the image of the suffering woman, she-tragedy provides a comforting ideal of gender relations that offsets the threatening aspects of uncontrolled female sexuality and its related power. Such corrupted and dangerous energy is destroyed by the end of the tragedy, but not before the audience is given a chance to savor the titillation it occasions; it is, in a sense, a way for spectators to have their cake and eat it too.” (99)</Text>

            <Title>Munns</Title>
            <Text>p. 185 - Belvidera is meant to be far off in safety, on the margins of the political action
“Both women trade on their sexual allure and attempt to force recognition of that allure, which the men seek to subordinate, into the center of political life.” (187)
Belvidera’s “blindness and indifference to male honor — its codes of revenge, its pledges, and oaths — opens up the text to an alternative female discourse that implicitly denies and challenges the dominant discourse of the fathers/husbands.” (188) - I disagree; she doesn’t have anything to offer instead
p. 193 - Belvidera uses words to unmask Jaffeir’s manly illusions
p. 195 - the senate swearing oaths — in the network it’s a strong tie of group to individuals but Munns sees it as suspect / innefective
p. 198-9 “the only communities on offer are fractured families, the corrupt state, the / equally corrupt conspiracy, and Belvidera’s community of pleasure and passion” — but Belvidera’s community is one that has no social world behind it, just ‘Belvidera soliloquy’</Text>

            <Text>“The turn... to plots involving human sacrifice-- the father-king's obligation to sacrifice his daughter for the sake of the nation, for example-- brings sharpening focus on conflicts between systems of authority and their constituent members" (366)
“dramatists started to explore a perceived homology between sacrificial and monetary transactions: ways in which modern trades in human life and labor recreated the ancient transactions of human sacrifice." (367)
in Venice Preserved “we see a progressive literalization of the metaphors with which culture describes its own residually primitive strands, until they have returned in all their original nature and are no longer metaphoric." (369)
"Jaffeir turns his suicide into a formal sacrificial ritual: a ritual to solemnize and effect the equally primitive ceremony of a curse” (369)
notes a connection between Aquilina sacrificing Antonio to secure Pierre's affection, and Jaffeir sacrificing Belvidera to secure the approval of the conspirators (371)
“The characters in Venice Preserv'd are enmeshed in a monetary culture, while dreaming of alternative and more primitive systems of exhange.” (372)
"The prototype of monetary exchange is that of bodies: hence the imaginative association of prostitution and sacrifice." (372)
“the surrender of power in not merely a primal prehistoric act; it has to be reenacted continually, day after day. How do you prevent someone from killing you? You appease him by giving him the power to do so,and thereby prove that you are not a threat." (373)
conspirators wanting to kill Jaffeir is “a prolonged and agonizing study in meaningless choice, since Jafffeir has already left and is not available to be killed.” (373)
"a particularly extended display of a social mechanism that governs many of the scenes in the play: forestalling the threat of violence by offering yourself to it. But what if the ploy fails or-- still worse-- if the of/fer is accepted? That is sacrifice.” (373-4)
“Sacrifice is what happens when the rituals of submission fail: when the proferred victim is claimed, or when, instead of offering your own life as a pledge in an exchange benefitting yourself, you find it offered by someone else on his own account.” (374)
“For Otway, sacrifice /is/ the primal outburst of violence. THe secondary one, the pacificatory offering of your own life, is a means of keeping sacrifice at bay." (374)
Belvidera offers herself to Jaffeir's dagger in order to avoid being killed
“Antonio's scenes belong in the play not because everyone in it is a masochist, but because rituals of submission are a fundamental organizing principle of life." (374)
“The male bonding that dominates the play can only work if the competing power of the female is rejected... For, in general, the threat of violence comes from men, and only strong men need to submit to prove they are no threat." (375)
“use of women as currency in the maintenance of male relationships” (378)

            <Text>Where Rogers and Gruber disagree, of course, is the extent to which Belvidera, as [Representative Woman], was ever likely to have the power to resist. Rogers argues that, despite the homosocial focus of the plot, Otway expresses a “confidence in feminine values” and “affirms their validity in balance with masculine ones” (391) even as those values are [inevitably destroyed by patriarchy]] [Gruber agrees that the play stages a masculine vs feminine battle that the feminine loses, but does not take this as promoting gendered balance] [Instead, Gruber argues, the defeat of the feminine is displayed for prurient enjoyment by an unproblematically masculinized audience]</Text>

\f0\fs24 \cf0 Belvidera and Aquilina look, at first, to be in highly similar positions on the margins of the social world, connected only to servants and to two men who vie for their allegiance. However, their impact on the structural cohesion of the network couldn\'92t be more different: despite the fact that Belvidera is directly connected to five characters and Aquilina only three, Aquilina\'92s removal splits the play network in two, and Belvidera\'92s affects only the small Belvidera-Priuli-Jaffeir triangle. In an otherwise unbalanced, diffuse structure, Belvidera is part of one of the only clusters: everybody she knows also knows most of her acquaintances. Her presence in the cluster could be a measure of importance, as it is for Claudius in 
\i Hamlet
\i0 , but it could just as easily be a measure of some superfluity, as it is for Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Indeed, none of the measures of network importance considered here \'97 the region of death, the measures of centrality, experiments in cohesion \'97 make a case for Belvidera as a heroine. However, given her enormous impact on audiences, her lack of importance in the network suggests not that she is unimportant, but that her importance is located outside the social exchanges of her fictional world. Her second-strongest tie after Jaffeir is to her own soliloquies: these speeches may be unable to reach her fellow inhabitants of the play, but that does not mean they are entirely unheard.}

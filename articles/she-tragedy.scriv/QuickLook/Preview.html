<p class="binderItem"><strong>abstract</strong><br/>Nicholas Rowe coined the term “she-tragedy” in 1714 to refer to a recently successful kind of tragedy, which takes advantage of the still-new presence of actresses on the Restoration stage to present spectables of female suffering. She-tragedies took pathetic tragedy to its logical extreme, and were extremely different from the heroic dramas that pre-dated them. The characteristic marginalization-yet-theatrical-power is captured in the dynamics of the play’s social network, as the heroines speak...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>wikipedia on she-tragedy</strong><br/>When English drama was reborn in 1660 with the re-opening of the theatres, the leading tragic style was the male-dominated heroic dramawhich celebrated powerful, aggressively masculine heroes and their pursuit of glory, as rulers and conquerors as well as lovers. In the 1670s and 1680s, a gradual shift occurred from heroic to pathetic tragedy, where the subject was love and domestic concerns, even though the main characters might be public figures.

(revise to include the word “graph” if I am accepted?)<br/>
The gendered role of the actress on stage, from the seventeenth century through the eighteenth, is often discussed in terms of the spectacle of the female body. In contrast, I turn my attention to the role of speech. In the eighteenth-century fad for “she-tragedy,” a heroine could have an overwhelming impact on theatregoers — but often very little impact on her fellow characters. ...</p>

I write to suggest a paper for your consideration, for your panel “Theatre as communication” at MLA. I have been undertaking a digital project examining the social networks implicit within play scripts, focusing on the role of the speech act between characters. I am presenting on the technical underpinnings of the project at the annual Digital Humanities conference this summer, and [think MLA would be interested in the literary part] <br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>abstract</strong><br/>Nicholas Rowe coined the term “she-tragedy” in 1714 to refer to a recently successful kind of tragedy, which takes advantage of the still-new presence of actresses on the Restoration stage to present spectables of female suffering.

<p class="binderItem"><strong>wikipedia on she-tragedy</strong><br/>When English drama was reborn in 1660 with the re-opening of the theatres, the leading tragic style was the male-dominated heroic dramawhich celebrated powerful, aggressively masculine heroes and their pursuit of glory, as rulers and conquerors as well as lovers. In the 1670s and 1680s, a gradual shift occurred from heroic to pathetic tragedy, where the subject was love and domestic concerns, even though the main characters might be public figures.

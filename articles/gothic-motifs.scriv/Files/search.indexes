            <Title>my model of Tracy</Title>
            <Text>I take Tracy’s model to its logical extension by foregrounding her motifs. I distilled her index of 208 motifs into 92 charts of motifs which appear in at least 20 works. Using her model to investigate the possibility of a women’s Gothic, I examine the potential predictive power of each motif. I ask whether the presence of any given motif in a work constitutes meaningful information regarding the probable gender of that work’s author. A series of procedural design choices emphasizes the qualitative interpretation inherent in my framing of this question. An identifiable gendered school immediately emerges: 38 distinctly male-authored motifs indicate a men’s Gothic defined by largely the things we would expect men to dominate.</Text>
            <Comments>Due to Tracy’s interest in uniqueness, 138 of the 208 motifs she indexes appear in fewer than 20 novels, and have thus been excluded from this study. Most motifs contain a number of sub-categories. In most cases, I further distilled each motif to its simplest form by ignoring these sub-categories. “Poison,” for example, is indexed with categories for “blade,” “chaplet,” “kiss,” “letter,” “orange,” “plant on grave,” and “sacrificial wine”, but I have elided these nuances in favor of a broader motif of “poison (all subcategories),” which applies to 30 novels. In cases where a sub-category contains more than 20 novels in and of itself, I have graphed that sub-category as if it were its own motif. “Death,” for example, is divided into the sub-categories “emotionally induced,” “pre-nuptial,” and “sad and/or pious,” of which both “emotionally induced” and “sad/pious” include more than 20 novels. Ultimately, the 70 key motifs generated 92 charts. 
I chose pie charts, one per motif, to visually represent Tracy’s treatment of each motif as a self-contained field which may or may not have distinct divisions within it. The size of each circle reflects the prevalence of the motif within the body of indexed novels as whole. More subtly, the difference between the two shades of gray in each chart reflects the difference between the two percentages. I wished to avoid graphs whose labels said that a motif featured a 50/50 split, but whose stark contrast nonetheless implied that books by male versus female authors could be easily distinguished from each other. Instead, I wanted my reader's ease in distinguishing between male and female authors to be directly connected to the ease with which a reader in the 1790s might have been able to accomplish the same task if given only the information that a certain motif was present. Accordingly, if the motif itself is not useful as a tool to distinguish between two gendered camps, its chart doesn’t show two camps.
I interpret a motif to be “distinctly male” if 60% or more of its authors are male.</Comments>

            <Text>This paper examines more than five hundred pre-Victorian Gothic works to ask whether female writers created categorically different works than their male peers. Two qualitative bibliographies of the Gothic provide “motifs” and “Gothic types” for computational modelling. In these models, many of the literary features which have been attributed to the ‘Female Gothic’ or to the ‘school of Radcliffe’ are, in fact, particular to Ann Radcliffe herself. Radcliffe thus stands in contrast to Matthew Lewis, whose horror-based ‘school of Lewis’ does constitute a gendered men’s Gothic.

            <Title>men's Gothic</Title>
            <Text>Comparing these male-dominated motifs to the neutral or female-dominated motifs involves constant escalation. Women may write about libertines (64% female), whose seductions may be coercive and almost always end poorly for their victims, but men write about the act of rape itself (75% male). Tracy’s motifs suggest that the darkest side of the Gothic was primarily the province of men: death is female-dominated when it is sad or pious (61% female), but murder is male-dominated (64% male), as are blood (68% male), corpses (70% male), and skeletons and skulls (73% male). When male authors write about death, then, it seems that they dwell not on its emotional impact, but on its more vivid physical results. Similarly, human sacrifice (64% male), starvation (67% male), torture (67% male), and putrefaction (74% male), all involve directly depicting that which other novels might merely imply. The masculine impulse to “go farther,” to replace coy allusions with unflinching enactments, is most evident in these novels’ treatment of incest. General themes of incest are widespread, appearing in 51 of the 208 novels under consideration — nearly a quarter of the works. However, in 45 of those novels, there are no cases of what Tracy terms “actual” incest, only “incest, literary flirtation with (including false alarms, foiled attempts, threats, and unconsummated incestuous passion).” The narrative discretion behind a literary fliration with incest is employed roughly equally by both male and female authors (54% male / 46% female), and makes up the vast majority of all depictions of incest. However, six cases of actual, no-narrative-flinching incest are documented— and all six are by men. To force one’s readers to look directly at the horrors depicted, rather than allowing them to become terrified by their own imaginations, is, of course, the technique of the horror Gothic, as contrasted with the terror Gothic. Identifying the horror Gothic as a predominantly male affair comes as no surprise, and accords nicely with the critical tradition of identifying Matthew Lewis as the quintessential horror Gothic writer. Together, these motifs point to a distinct men’s Gothic in the Lewisian horror tradition.</Text>

            <Title>Tracy values uniqueness</Title>
            <Text>Tracy’s bibliography is built to be more like a particularly helpful finding aid than a comprehensive check-list.  Her most unusual qualitative bibliographical work is her ten-page “Index to Motifs” identifying the books in which 208 different “motifs” appear. Tracy uses the term “motif” broadly to encompass a wide range of plot elements, images, and character types. The index is intended for “scholars with particular interests”, who wish to locate and read books containing individual story elements, such as “doppelganger” or “garden as scene of temptation”. Accordingly, Tracy prioritizes presenting a wide range of highly distinctive motifs rather than those that constitute the norm. Indeed, she intentionally excluded the most popular motifs: “the abundance of murders,” she says, “argued for the retention… of specialized murders only,” and castles have similarly been ingored. In addition to the motifs, Tracy provides a plot summary of each novel. Her summaries, too, emphasize distinctive details, pointing out things like “a particularly interesting Satan, with molten insides”. As a model of the Gothic, Tracy’s bibliography elides continuities to increase its sensitivity to points of difference. It treats each novel as a collection of discrete elements, only one of which is likely to be of interest to a given scholar. The motifs themselves — Satans, murders, doppelgangers, gardens — are thus constructed as the stable objects of study, which must be examined through the filter of individual novels.</Text>

            <Title>women's Gothic</Title>
            <Text>Instead, in this model of the genre, the women’s Gothic seems to be defined by only four things: libertines (64% female), forced weddings (62% female), sad or pious deaths (61% female), and miniature portraits (61% female). The libertines and miniature portraits in particular, as the most common female motifs, immediately suggest a women’s Gothic that is in striking conversation with novels like Jane Austen’s, whose ordered and rational novels are nonetheless repelete with rakes and miniatures. Or, looking at their prominence in the top ten for each of these tropes, one might be tempted to investigate Regina Maria Roche and Louisa Sidney Stanhope as the unexpected representatives of the women’s Gothic. However, narrow margin of [dominance] for each motif suggests that defining a genre here may be too hasty. The male motifs represented a variety of elements used by many different men, such that no one author could be responsible for its gendered uptake. These female motifs are far less robust: if we ignore either Roche or Stanhope, we are down to just two female-dominated motifs, and if we ignore both, we are left with zero. When it comes to the inclusion of particular story elements, then, this women’s Gothic is outnumbered not just by the men’s Gothic but also by the mainstream Gothic.</Text>

            <Title>Abstract feedback from Alyssa</Title>
            <Text>Hello from Detroit!

That's so exciting about the chapbook! It throws a wrench in the works, but having two plagiarized works to draw on could bring out some really interesting new conclusions (or significantly strengthen the existing ones).

1. The most important idea was that men and women don't write substantially different gothic texts.

2. Each individual sentence is very clear. They feel a little disjointed, but once I read through the abstract the whole picture fell into place. The only place where I could use a little more context is the last sentence. That's in part because I'm missing some of the vocabulary and background knowledge, and in part because I'm not sure how your analysis connects to that conclusion. It sounds like an idea with some sweeping implications, so it might deserve a little more context. 

3. I think you could maybe trim down a little here: 

"This paper turns to the popular Gothic, to ask whether the hundreds of female Gothic writers created categorically different works than their hundreds of male peers."

To

"This paper examines hundreds of popular Gothic works to ask whether female writers created categorically different works than their male peers."

26 to 21 words--not a huge difference, but it might give you some room elsewhere. That change depends on whether the goal of "hundreds" in the original sentence was to indicate the overall size of your sample or the large number of female gothic writers in the eighteenth century... my version would cover the former, but is less effective at communicating the latter.

Let me know how it goes! I love being a part of your process with these things.

Love and luck,

            <Title>mainstream Gothic</Title>
            <Text>More than half of the motifs under consideration are not strongly gendered in either direction. Four are even perfect ties: elopement (all subcategories); dueling and other single combat; fainting, female; and rediscovery of lost relatives. Moreover, the more popular a motif is — that is, the larger a role it plays in constituting the default expectations of the genre — the more likely it is to be non-gendered. Indeed, all of the strongly male-dominated motifs are much less common than the more neutral motifs. The neutrality of the most popular motifs is essentially a mathematical inevitability: nothing can achieve more than 50% popularity while being used by only 50% of authors. The Gothic mainstream must be defined by that which is available to all authors within the genre. In terms of sheer prevalence, the defining features of the Gothic appear to be fainting (present in 77% of all novels), confinement (66% of novels), abduction (57%), references to suicide (47%), and storms (44%). Only one of those five motifs, suicide (61% male), shows hints of a gendered divide.</Text>
            <Comments>That is, the defining features of the Gothic which nonetheless struck Ann Tracy as singular enough to be worth indexing — castles, for example, might have topped this list, if they hadn’t been considered too common to index. However, convents, ghosts, and corpses were all in the running for defining motifs, but were insuffiiently prevalent.</Comments>

            <Title>no binaries</Title>
            <Text>This motif-based model of the early Gothic suggests that, rather than a balanced oppositions of Radcliffe’s female terror Gothic versus Lewis’s male horror Gothic, the genre as a popular movement was defined by a less-sensationalist (possibly Radcliffean, possibly terror-mode) non-genered Gothic mainstream, with a subset of male horror Gothic writers making up a minor tradition within it. These results serve as a useful reminder that not all contrasts are perfect binaries; the existence of a men’s Gothic tradition does not require that everything outside that tradition be a perfectly-opposed women’s Gothic.</Text>

            <Text>In contrast to this abundance of male-dominated tropes, female-authored tropes are elusive. The Radcliffean plot elements of subterranean passages (61% male), caves (61% male), and secret doors (59% male) turn out to be firmly correlated with male authors, not female. This is not to say that these motifs are not Radcliffean: Radcliffe alone accounts for 7% of all caves, 11% of all secret doors, and an astonishing 15% of all subterannean passages. Indeed, she is the top author for both subterranean passages and secret doors. But beyond Radcliffe, these tropes have been disproportionately adopted by men, not women. The critical emphasis on subterranean passages and caves as crucial Gothic tropes can likely be explained by who makes the “top 10” lists of their use:

Although neither motif appears widely throughout the Gothic, they repeat within the works of all four authors typically taken as the landmark writers of the genre: Walpole for the Gothic’s birth, Radcliffe and Lewis for its flourishing, and Maturin for its end. Anything prominently used by all four is surely ripe for closely-read comparison. But those comparisons illuminate more about the individual authors than the Gothic’s general usage; and, in the case of subterranean passages, they tell us more about Radcliffe than they do a women’s Gothic.</Text>

“As demonstrated in her essay “the Dream of a transparent Body: Identity, Science and the Gothic novel” (Gothic Studies 14.1 [2012]: 74–92), Wagner’s primary intellectual concern is to identify the “deeply embedded historical continuities running through” gothic  ction as well as medical science”

“these thematic categories—“uses of the Past/Medievalism”; “Politics, Law, religion, Economics, and race”; “Medicine, Science, and the Body”; “Gender”; “Sexuality”; “Psychology and Emotion”—reflect contemporary scholarly interests in gothic studies”

In her introductory essays, rather than advancing a singular thesis, she participates in the ongoing debates about the Gothic. Her representation of the Gothic thus mirrors her claims about the mode itself: as characterized by instability, by a subversive resistance to definition.”</Text>

Ch. 1: largely about readership, esp. circulating libraries
Ch. 2: the four 'schools' of the novel building on early 18thC masters: the Richardsonian, the Fielding...eqsue, Smollett's picaresque, and Sterne's wanderings. Tompkins discusses a really wide range of popular novels and how they fit into each category. "the accepted themes were repeated in a shallower tone and overlaid with all the romantic incidents of disguise, abduction, lost heirs and mistaken identity, which had been for hundreds of years the story-teller's stock in trade." (57) --&gt; contains a problematic assumption that the 'goal' of the novel is to become realist ("In spite of critical admonitions, the average novelist paid, on the whole, very little attention to the probable, and the novel in consequence slipped farther away from reality, as though a window on to the other world had been changed to a magic lantern" (57) -- but we can reject this assumption (on the basis of our more modern criticism) without rejecting the observation that 'fantastic' (Gothic) plot elements do not fundamentally alter the societally conventional structure of the novel.
- seems to move into discussion of sensational novel; "Rape, jealous frenzy and murder are staple ingredients of these novels, and the general method is cumulative." (61)
- "Two points have some interest in connection with the sensationalism of the eighteenth century. In the first place there is, on the whole, little insistence upon physical pain... Secondly, one notes the extraordinary pervasiveness through all grades of the novel of the theme of incest." (62)

            <Text>The novel of sentiment:
“Sarah Fielding and Charlotte Lennox, both brought up in the school of Richardson, yielded eventually to the taste for something less humdrum than domestic realism, and at the same time, far from renouncing or abating their fits of emotional indulgence and their pervading sentimentality, screwed up the tension, and dragged their lovers and heroines through stranger trials and more sensational adventures than could be counted among ordinary contingencies.” (Baker 91)
“Richardson had founded the English novel of sensibility; but, after all, sensibility was ot an object with Richardson, who wrote to inculcate prudence and self-control. … But sensibility soon became an object of engrossing interest and an end in itself” (Baker 95)

“That amoral person Sterne cared nothing for edification… He fondled his sensibility, he never tired of playing with it; he was a debauched sentimentalist, aware of his vice, and voluptuously enjoying all its sweetness” (95 Baker)

“It would be inexact to say that the influence of Richardson was waning towards the end of the seventeen-sixties; if his novels were tending to go out of favour and to be superseded by new kinds of sentimental fiction, it was simply that he had established a cult and his devotees had gone beyong him.” (Baker 96) - Sterne and Mackenzie as prime examples
“It was the French Richardsonians, pursuing a trend already observable in their own literature, who first outwent their acknowledged leader.” (Baker 97)

“Some signs of the romantic scene-painting soon to be a marked characteristic of Gothic fiction are observable in Julia de Roubigné, and may reasonably be credited to the example of Prévost, who loved to set the stage gloomily for the experiences of his ill-starred lovers.” (Baker 110) “sensitivity to the sombre and dearful, which was presently to reach a fever-pitch in Charlotte Smith and Mrs Radcliffe” (Baker 110)

“moral improvement was decidedly the chief end that he [i.e., Mackenzie] envisaged in estimating the value of fiction; in other words, he takes exactly the same view as Dr Johnson and most other critics of that day” (Baker 112)
but Mackenzie doesn’t consider himself a sentimental novelist?

Henry Brooke more sentimental than Mackenzie — “Brook’s hero and his friends burst into tears alike in sympathy with grief and at any example of human affection or of nobility of soul.” (Baker 115)

novel of sensibility is mostly a more intense novel of sentiment (Baker 120). At first, “Sensibility accepted the rule of reason” (Baker 121), but over time “though fiction came by various stages nearer to life,” “In the later romances… sensibility was forced like a hot-house plant, and grew more and more artificial, affected, pretentious” (121).

“The novels of Prévost contain all the materials for the novel of sensibility. They also have in them a good part of the material that was son to be utilized in what came to be nicknamed the Gothic novel.” (Baker 130) primarily “his gloomy scene-painting”
“Prévost was less than half a realist, and much more than half a romancer” (Baker 131) …a variety of French authors who build on &amp; exaggerate Prévost

“The most distinguished English novel in line of descent from Richardson, which shows unmistakable traces of some infusion of blood from… Prévost… is that novel by Mrs Frances Sheridan, Memoirs of Miss Sidney Bidulph… (1761)” (Baker 141)

The History of the English Novel, Volume V: The Novel of Sentiment and the Gothic Romance

Enormous interlude on Fanny Burney, who “provides an interlude of natural comedy in the long monotone of solemn and pretentious sentimentalism” (154)

“Mystery and Wonder, Fear and Suspense, Sensation and Terror, are some of the labels affixed by different historians to the romantic novels that traded in one or another, or in all of these excitements, during the last few decades of the eighteenth century. The rather absurd term ‘Gothic’ is perhaps more convenient, and may be allowed to include both those than contented themselves with a discreet use of fear and suspense, and also those which sought the grosser sensations of terror and brutally aimed to make the flesh creep.” (Baker 175)
“It was a term applied first in derision… Then it was amiably accepted by Walpole and others, who confessed a fondness for what they called Gothic, little as they understood the real nature of what they admired, and grotesque as were their attempts to imitate it.”

“The sources of Gothic romance… are to be sought in the popular variant of the fiction of sensibility evolved by the Abbé Prévost and elaborated later on by Baculard d’Arnaud. The exciting adventures, the violent emotions, the gloomy scenes, forests, and antres, castles, dungeons, and graveyards, in the abbé’s novels and the plays and stories of Baculard, were to be the distinctive features of Gothic romance throughout its course. It was all a derivative of the cult of emotion” (Baker 175)
“Some novelists sought only to conjure up a witching atmosphere of awe and vague apprehension; others employed the most violent shocks of physical anguish and fear. They all dabbled in the supernatural, either playing upon or playing with feelings of superstition; and, later on, those who had become acquainted with German folk-lore and its ghosts and elves and goblins found their account in satiating the greediest appetites for crime, diabolism, and nameless horrors.” (Baker 176)</Text>

            <Text>“Most critics who have given any attention to Mrs. Radcliffe as a novelist have decided that she is important chiefly for her use of the supernatural, and for her emphasis upon landscape. Although she is, indeed, a pioneer in both these fields, it has seemed to me that, after all, her most important contribution is a matter not of theme, but of structure.” (McIntyre 77)
“Mrs. Radcliffe’s method is founded upon the principle // which Walpole tried with imperfect success to embody in his work — the principle of suspence” (79-80)
Radcliffe’s peers are “Matthew Gregory Lewis, Mrs. Inchbald, and Charlotte Smith” (93)
“One of the reviews of /The Mysteries of Udolpho/ closes with these words: ‘This is the best composition of this kind since Mrs. Inchbald’s /Simple Story/.’ The expression, ‘this kind,’ is a little puzzling here. The reviewer must surely be thinking of fiction in general, for, except that they are both fiction, two compositions could hardly be more unlike than The Mysteries of Udolpho and A Simple Story.” (McIntyre 94) “…the ethical purpose of the book is rather too obvious for successful art. Mrs. Radcliffe, it is true, was strictly moral… but her main interest does not lie there.”</Text>

	This book’s central task is the reframing of the text-genre relationship, arguing that texts “do not ‘belong’ to genres but are, rather, uses of them” (2). Genres function by “mediat[ing] between a social situation” of a reader embedded in real and literary contexts, “and the text which realises certain features of this situation, or which responds strategically to its demands” (14). Rather than reading genre simply to categorize “where a text ‘belongs,’” Frow argues, “we read… for those layers of background knowledges that texts evoke” through their genre relationships, which allow an assessment of “which types of meaning are appropriate and relevant,” and therefore how the text can be made to make sense (101). Frow concludes that “what we learn, in ‘doing’ genre (in performing and transforming it) is the values we share or don’t share with others and the means with which to challenge or defend them” (144).</Text>

	This book, perhaps the first to pay serious scholarly attention to the wide reach of the Gothic, puts forth “a set of descriptions which will both help to identify the historical Gothic while suggesting reasons for its survival and for the multifarious forms in which it has survived” (20-21). Examining works from the birth of the Gothic to his present day, Punter identifies the unifying element of the Gothic as fear, expressed through a “dialectic of comfort and disturbance” and “a continuous oscillation between reassurance and threat” (423). In his final proposal of “a theory of the Gothic,” he argues that “Gothic fiction becomes a process of cultural self-analysis, and the images which it throws up become the dream-figures of a troubled social group.” with “the glance over the shoulder”—a nostalgic attempt to understand the past—as the inherent function of the ghost-story. The Gothic, “at the psychological interface between the well-ordered psyche and its rebel subjects,” may not provide an escape, but can provide “refuge while at the same time undermining the architectural fabric” of the bourgeois ideology which attempts to “naturalise” the unstable situation of society (425-6).

            <Title>Price</Title>
            <Text>Building toward a reading of the writing style of George Eliot, this book examines in detail the historical conditions of the rise of the anthology and its relationship to the seemingly un-anthologizable novel. Of particular interest is her detailed investigation of the many reworkings of Clarissa published alongside that text, from tables-of-contents meant to help readers ‘catch up’ to a current volume to editions consisting only of the Bible verses Clarissa reads. Price draws attention to the ways in which all reading, and particularly all scholarly writing, must involve a constant re-editing of texts, influenced by memory and argument. She concludes with an argument that the works of George Eliot are written intentionally to anticipate their anthologies.

These changes are in keeping with Leah Price’s argument that editing a text does not simply produce a deformed version of the original, but rather produces a new text. Price takes Samuel Richardson’s Clarissa as the prime example of a novel surrounded by re-edited versions of itself; as she notes, each new abridgement reveals its editor’s “unspoken assumptions about the most efficient way to convey information, and indeed what counts as information at all” (13). In the years after Clarissa’s completion, alternate versions proliferated, each rewriting Richardson’s text to suit a new niche: abridgements in which the epistolary format has been replaced with an impersonal retrospective narrator (15); collections of “moral sentiments” excerpted and arranged alphabetically (17); an anthology of the Bible verses mentioned, but not quoted, in the novel, intermingled with both excerpts and summaries (24). Even the index of chapters, originally prefixed to the second edition “in the expectation that readers would have forgotten the beginning by the time they reached the end” (13), circulated as an independent pamphlet that could not just supplement the full text, but potentially replace it (17). Most importantly, several of these rewritings were carried out by Richardson himself; as the author of the original, he would have no need to identically replicate his own approach, but must have arranged each new editions with a different slant.
Richardson’s case establishes the general principle; when Price turns her attention to Radcliffe, she sees Radcliffe’s works as primarily interesting for their intermingling of prose with poetry. Radcliffe’s “beauties” (92), she argues, play the same role as do Richardson’s sentiments: readers may attempt to race through the book “wth. a View only to Story” (Richardson, qtd. in Price 21), but the structure of the book itself will discipline them.  Price’s description of Clarissa seems equally apt for the works of both authors: “the sententious passages which pepper the novel itself are designed less (through their content) to inculcate specific moral lessons than (through their structure) to regulate the pace of reading” (21). However, there is no need to interpret Radcliffe’s “embellishments” (95) as punitive. If nothing else, epigraphs and poems are an unlikely choice of corrective for an author battling the sin of skipping, since their typographical isolation allows readers to identify and ignore them almost without a thought.  Rather, I argue that Radcliffe’s notably extensive “beauties” are, like the technique of the explained supernatural, part of the political-aesthetic agenda discussed above.
Just as her rational explanations allowed Radcliffe to incorporate empowering myths unapologetically into modern literature, so too do her “embellishments” allow her to demonstrate her literary seriousness. Price herself notes that the prevalence in the novel of material that ought not be skipped, particularly her original poetry, “differentiates Radcliffe,” in reviewers’ minds, “from mere entertainers” (97). But Radcliffe doesn’t simply write and quote poetry: she also fills her text with landscapes and architecture, drawing on the literary traditions of travel narratives; with moral contemplations that wouldn’t be out of place in popular sentimental novels; with dramatic structures and staging that owe an obvious debt to the theatre; and, of course, with all the traditions of romance. Even the frustrating digressions of her comic servants come straight from Shakespeare. Walpole had, much earlier, “designedly” introduced bumbling servants based on the model of a “higher authority,” namely, “the great master of nature, SHAKESPEARE” (22). Indeed, Walpole provides a direct description of the Gothic-as-new-Classic framework, comparing Shakespeare to “the Grecian sculptor, who, to convey the idea of a Colossus… inserted a little boy measuring his thumb” (22). But whereas Walpole must explain and justify his lineage, Radcliffe allows it to go without saying. Walpole’s preface points to specific characters, and scenes, but Radcliffe attributes her epigraphs, whichever play they are drawn from or character they are spoken by, to, simply, “Shakespeare.” In the strength of her unifying vision, Radcliffe is like the Romantic poet, discussed by Tilar Mazzeo; she subordinates all her literary borrowings to a singular goal, ‘mastering’ them with her individual genius, and thus transforms them. Udolpho’s “beauties” go beyond embellishment to create a deeply intertextual novel, which is built upon diverse foundations but stands upon its own authority.

            <Text>“ Gardin refers to "simulation," Frye to "modeling." Both of these rather ill-defined terms share a common epistemological sense: use of a likeness to gain knowledge of its original. We can see immediately why computing should be spoken of in these terms, as it represents knowledge of things in manipulable form, thus allows us to simulate or model these things.”

“My intention here is to summarize the available help, chiefly from the history and philosophy of the natural sciences, especially physics, where most of the relevant work is to be found. I concentrate on the term "modeling" because that is the predominate term in scientific practice — but it is also, perhaps even by nature, the term around which meanings I find the most useful tend to cluster. I will then give an extended example from humanities computing and discuss the epistemological implications. Finally I will return to Jean-Claude Gardin's very different agenda, what he calls "the logicist programme," and to closely allied questions of knowledge representation in artificial intelligence.”

“Historians and philosophers of science, including both of these, have tried their best to anatomize modeling on the basis of the only reliable source of evidence — namely actual scientific practice. But this is precisely what makes the conceptual difficulty significant: modeling grows out of practice, not out of theory, and so is rooted in stubbornly tacit knowledge — i.e., knowledge that is not merely unspoken but may also be unspeakable.”

“The most basic distinction is, in Clifford Geertz's terms, between "an 'of' sense and a 'for' sense" of modeling (1993/1973: 93). A model of something is an exploratory device, a more or less "poor substitute" for the real thing (Groenewold 1961: 98). We build such models-of because the object of study is inaccessible or intractable, like poetry or subatomic whatever-they-are. In contrast a model for something is a design, exemplary ideal, archetype or other guiding preconception. Thus we construct a model of an airplane in order to see how it works; we design a model for an airplane to guide its construction. A crucial point is that both kinds are imagined, the former out of a pre-existing reality, the latter into a world that doesn't yet exist, as a plan for its realization.”

“In both cases, as Russian sociologist Teodor Shanin has argued, the product is an ontological hybrid: models, that is, bridge subject and object, consciousness and existence, theory and empirical data (1972: 9). They comprise a practical means of playing out the consequences of an idea in the real world. Shanin goes on to argue that models-of allow the researcher to negotiate the gulf between a "limited and selective consciousness" on the one hand and "the unlimited complexity and 'richness' of the object" on the other (1972: 10). This negotiation happens, Shanin notes, "by purposeful simplification and by transformation of the object of study inside consciousness itself." In other words, a model-of is made in a consciously simplifying act of interpretation. Although this kind of model is not necessarily a physical object, the goal of simplification is to make tractable or manipulable what the modeler regards as interesting about it.”

“A fundamental principle for modeling-of is the exact correspondence between model and object with respect to the webs of relationships among the selected elements in each. Nevertheless, such isomorphism (as it is called) may be violated deliberately in order to study the consequences. In addition to distortions, a model-of may also require "properties of convenience," such as the mechanism by which a model airplane is suspended in a wind-tunnel. Thus a model-of is fictional not only by being a representation, and so not the thing itself, but also by selective omission and perhaps by distortion and inclusion as well.”

“Since modeling is pragmatic, the worth of a model must be judged by its fruitfulness. The principle of isomorphism means, however, that for a model-of, this fruitfulness is meaningful in proportion to the "goodness of the fit" between model and original, as Black points out (1962: 238). But at the same time, more than a purely instrumental value obtains. A model-of is not constructed directly from its object; rather, as a bridge between theory and empirical data, the model participates in both, as Shanin says. In consequence a good model can be fruitful in two ways: either by fulfilling our expectations, and so strengthening its theoretical basis, or by violating them, and so bringing that basis into question. I argue that from the research perspective of the model, in the context of the humanities, failure to give us what we expect is by far the more important result, however unwelcome surprises may be to granting agencies.”

“This is so because, as the philosopher of history R. G. Collingwood has said, "Science in general … does not consist in collecting what we already know and arranging it in this or that kind of pattern. It consists in fastening upon something we do not know, and trying to discover it That is why all science begins from the knowledge of our own ignorance: not our ignorance of everything, but our ignorance of some definite thing … " (1993/1946: 9). When a good model fails to give us what we expect, it does precisely this: it points to "our ignorance of some definite thing.””

“It is a computational model because the analysis that defines it obeys two fundamental rules: total explicitness and absolute consistency. Thus everything to be modeled must be explicitly represented, and it must be represented in exactly the same way every time.”

“The imaginative language of poetry doesn't survive well under such a regime. But this is only what we expect from modeling, during which (as Teodor Shanin said) the "limited and selective consciousness" of the modeler comes up against "the unlimited complexity and 'richness' of the object." In the case of poetry the result can only be a model of the tinker-toy variety, Vannevar Bush's "stone adze in the hands of a cabinetmaker." Nevertheless, with care, scholarly furniture may be made with this adze. In return for "suspension of ontological unbelief," as Black said about models generally (1962: 228), modeling gives us manipulatory power over the data of personification. With such a model we can then engage in the second-order modeling of these data by adjusting the factors and their weightings, producing different results and raising new questions. The model can be exported to other texts, tried out on them in a new round of recursive modeling, with the aim of producing a more inclusive model, or a better questions about personification from which a better model may be constructed. This is really the normal course of modeling in the sciences as well: the working model begins to converge on the theoretical model.”

At the same time, Edward Sapir famously remarked, "All grammars leak" (1921: 47). The failures of the model — the anomalous cases only special pleading would admit — are the leaks that reflect questioningly back on the theoretical model of the Metamorphoses and so challenge fundamental research. They point, again as Collingwood said, to our ignorance of a particular thing.


— Model For —

(1) experiment is an epistemological practice of its own, related to but not dependent on theory; and (2) experiment is not simply heuristic but, in the words the literary critic Jerome McGann borrowed famously from Lisa Samuels, is directed to "imagining what we don't know" (2001: 105ff), i.e., to making new knowledge. This is the face that modeling turns to the future, that which I have called the "model-for," but which must be understood in Hacking's interventionist sense.

Models-for do not have to be such conscious things. They can be the serendipitous outcome of play or of accident. What counts in these cases, Hacking notes, is not observation but being observant, attentive not simply to anomalies but to the fact that something is fundamentally, significantly anomalous — a bit of a more inclusive reality intruding into business as usual.

—

The conception of modeling I have developed here on the basis of practice in the physical sciences gives us a crude but useful machine with its crude but useful tools and a robust if theoretically unattached epistemology. It assumes a transcendent, imperfectly accessible reality for the artifacts we study, recognizes the central role of tacit knowledge in humanistic ways of knowing them and, while giving us unprecedented means for systematizing these ways, is pragmatically anti-realist about them. Its fruits are manipulatory control of the modeled data and, by reducing the reducible to mechanical form, identification of new horizons for research.

 Whereas modeling treats the ill-fitting residue of formalization as meaningfully problematic and problematizing, logicism exiles it — and that, I think, is the crucial point.

 We must beware that we do not pervert our wheels of logic into "symbols of objective mastery" over ourselves but use them to identify what they cannot compute. Their failures and every other well-crafted error we make are exactly the point, so that (now to quote the Bard precisely) we indeed are "Minding true things by what their mock'ries be" (Henry V iv.53).

            <Title>Frank values context</Title>
            <Text>Having explored one bibliographic model in depth, we now have a point of comparison for our next model of men and women’s Gothics. Although it attempts to model the same field, Frederick Frank’s bibliography encourages a very different understanding of the texts he indexes. Unlike Tracy, Frank is interested in not just what happens, but in how it happens. His “Critical Synopsis” of each text functions entirely differently from Tracy’s “Plot Summary,” often providing very few plot details in favour of describing the work’s literary borrowings, narrative structure, and historical reception. Unlike Tracy, he includes an assessment of each work’s “Gothic type,” but these “types” are not stable overarching categories: for his 500 texts, Frank provides 309 unique classifications. In their flexibility and detail, Frank’s “types” reflect Frow’s understanding of genre: it is impossible to classify each text into the genre to which it “belongs”; instead, Frank describes the generic expectations which each text uses. His Gothic type for Sophia Lee’s The Recess, for example, labels the novel as “Gothified history (terror and sentimental elements), connecting it simultaneously to the “Gothified history” of William Godwin’s St. Leon, the “terror mode” of Radcliffe’s novels, and the “sentimental Gothic” of Charlotte Dacre’s The Libertine and The Passions. These threads cannot be traced systematically — he provides no index or definition of the types themselves. They are hardly even deterministic: The Mysteries of Ferney Castle is listed twice, once under each of its disputed authors, and receives a different Gothic type in each entry (“Pure or high Gothic (terror mode)” at entry 188 by Robert Huish, and “Gothified history (Radcliffean imitation)” at entry 222 by G. Lambe). Instead, his Gothic types model the Gothic as a shifting history, with each novel as the temporary centre of influences that stretch both forward and backward in time.</Text>
            <Comments>The two bibliographies’ treatments of Grenville Fletcher’s Rosalviva, Or, The Demon Dwarf, for example, serves as a useful illustration of their differences. Tracy’s summary is a litany of events: it begins matter-of-factly with the sentence “Leontini loves Viola di Morini, but she marries someone else,” and is equally unfazed when the titular “demon dwarf” arrives in the third act and when the dwarven appearance turns out to be false (51). Frank, in contrast, spends more than half his words on context, as in his first sentence: 
“From Rumplestilskin in the fairytale to the comic evil of Dickens’s Daniel Quilp in The Old Curiosity Shop (1841), the figure of the dwarf was often called upon to perform such demonic services as vengeance, prophecy, child possession, and transformation.” (107) 
To this broad literary history he adds Mary Shelley’s story “Transformation” as potential precursor for the disguise in Fletcher’s novel, and includes several assessments of the Gothic’s particular embellishments of “the dwarf as a resolver of dilemmas of identity” (107) and “dwarfs... spin[ning] webs of murderous intrigue for diabolic ladies” (108). All of these details stand in stark contrast to Tracy’s unembellished list of seven novels under the index entry “dwarf” (199), which treats the sinister disguise in Rosalviva as interchangeable with depictions of non-supernatural and even non-evil little people.
Most of these are “unique” primarily from the point of view of a spreadsheet: “Domestic fiction (various Gothic elements)” and “Domestic fiction (intermittent Gothic elements),” for example, are distinguished only by a slight gradation of degree. But this interest in slight qualitative gradations is what distinguishes Frank’s model from Tracy’s.</Comments>

            <Text>It it telling that Samuels and McGann refer to their deformations as a “deformative program” which is “run… through a particular work” to produce unpredictable but replicable”results” (36).
[Samuels and McGann initially exclude modes of criticism that “do not aim to be interpretive” from their analysis; their examples of ostensibly non-interpretive criticism are “bibliographical studies and prosodic analysis” but [would include models like mine] (26).] [However, they ultimately conclude that it’s all interpretive (46).] 

Role of experiments: Interpreting a poem after it has been deformed clarifies the secondary status of the interpretation.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 40). “‘Meaning’ is important not as explanation but as residue. It is what is left behing after the experiment has been run. We develop it not to explain the poem but to judge the effectiveness of the experiment we undertook.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 48)
they class “bibliographical studies and prosodic analysis” — [which is basically my stuff] — as non-interpretive (26). [Therefore, that stuff that didn’t look “interpretive” actually is interpretive and can be deformed.]



“The usual object of interpretation is ‘meaning,’ or some set of ideas that can be cast in thematic form. These meanings are sought in different ways: as though resident ‘in’ the work, or evoked through ‘reader-response,’ or deconstructable … In all these cases, however, an essential relation is preserved between an artistic work and … some conceptual form that gets more or less fully articulated ‘for’ the work. To understand a work of art, interpreters try to close with a structure of thought that represents its essential idea(s).” (Samuels &amp; McGann 26)
They “propose… another way of engaging imaginative work” which “moves to break beyond conceptual analysis into … performative operations.” They argue that “concept-based interpretation, reading along thematic lines, is itself best understood as a particular type of performative and rhetorical operation.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 26)

Emily Dickinson’s habit of reading poems backward is “a spendid model for… deformative criticism” (Samuels &amp; McGann 28). “Her procedure… follows a romantic awareness… that poems lose their vital force when they succumb to familiarization” (Samuels &amp; McGann 28). Despite affinity with modernist techniques of estrangement, “Dickinson’s critical model is performative, not intellectual” (Samuels &amp; McGann 29). “Reading Backward short circuits the sign of prose transparency and reinstalls the text — any text, prose or verse — as a performative event, a made thing.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 30)

“First, imaginative work has an elective affinity with performance: it is organized as rhetoric and poiesis rather than as exposition and information-transmission. Because this is so, it always lies open to deformative moves.” Second, “criticism… tends to imagine itself as an informative rather than a deformative activity.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 33) “Here we want to point out that lines of performative and deformative critical activity have always existed,” including “Elaborate scholarly editions” and “translations” (Samuels &amp; McGann 33).
“Because ‘a translation [involves] the necessity of settling many points without discussion,’ [D.G.] Rosetti observes, it ‘remains perhaps the most direct form of commentary’ that can be brought to literary work.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 34). For people who dislike Rosetti’s translation, “The critical thoroughness and integrity… is exactly the problem.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 34).

“Deformative scholarship is all but forbidden, the thought of it either // irresponsible or damaging to critical seriousness” (Samuels &amp; McGann 34-5), likely because the prime example is “Forgery” (35) and the category also includes “mistaken and deviant readings produced… by students unaware of an ignorance in their … understanding” (35). But they set these aside in favor of “interpretive deformation,” as exemplified by “heretical and… nonnormative readings of established cultural artifacts” (Samuels and McGann 35).
“The reluctance shows… that interpreters — even radical ones — do not commonly locate hermeneutic vitality in the documentary features of literary works. Because meaning is assumed to develop as a linguistic event, critical deformance plays itself out in the field of the signifieds.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 35). “Critical and interpretive limits are thus regularly established” to excluse consideration of “the physical artifact, whose stability and integrity is taken as inbiolable” (Samuels &amp; McGann 35).
“From an interpretive point of view, this assumption brackets off from attention crutical features of imaginative works… so basic and conventionally governed — they are alphabetical and diacritical. they are the rules for character formation, character arrangement, and textual space, as well as for the structural forms of words, phrases, and higher morphemic and phonemic units— that readers tend to treat them as preinterpetive and precitical. In truth, however, they comprise the operating system of language” (Samuels &amp; McGann 35). “Linguists, semioticians, bibliographers, and cognitive theorists regularly explore these territories, but their work is not normally concerned with interpretation in the customary sense — that is, with explaining aesthetic and stylistic features of works” (Samuels &amp; McGann 36).
“But this enlargement of the subject matter of criticism does not define the most significant function of deformative operations. Far most important is the stochastic process it entails. … When we run the deformative program through a particular work we cannot predict the results.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 36). “…we are brought to a critical position in which we can imagine things about the text that we did not and perhaps could not otherwise know” (Samuels &amp; McGann 36). “A deformative procedure puts the reader in a highly idiosyncratic relation to the work,” so that “customary rules are… held in abeyance, to be chosen among… to be followed or nor as one decides,” resulting in “the dramatic exposure of subjectivity as a live and highly informative option of interpretive commentary” (Samuels &amp; McGann 36).

They focus on “poetic deformations,” “organized into four types:” (36) reordered, isolating, altering, and adding (36-7). They focus on reordering and isolating poems, taking Wallace Stevens as their experimental ground.

“deformance does not banish interpretation. The reversed text is still subject to, still giving of, interpretive readings. Deformance does want to show that the poem’s intelligibility is not a function of the interpretation, but that all interpretation is a function of the poem’s systemic intelligibility. Interpreting a poem after it has been deformed clarifies the secondary status of the interpretation.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 40).

“we may usefully regard all criticism and interpretation as deformance. Scholars murder to dissect, as Wordsworth famously observed” (Samuels &amp; McGann 46) *** JUST LIKE LEAH PRICE’S ARGUMENT —&gt; Despite approaching the matter from very different projects, [both] have reached a similar conclusion about the [state of criticism] which makes my own approach differ not in fundamenal kind from the norm, but in degree and in [reflexiveness? obviousness?].
“Interpretation is the application of scientia to poiesis, or the effort to elucidate one discourse form in terms of another.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 46).
“Interpretation for della Volpe… always displays a gap between the work being examined and the student. But this gap does not represent a failure of criticism, or even a mysticism of poiesis. It locates the source and end and test of the art being examined” (Samuels &amp; McGann 47). The gap comes into being as soon as the critic must paraphrase the text. “Interpretation, then, is a constellation of paraphrases that evolve… from an uncritical to a critical moment” (Samuels &amp; McGann 47)
In della Volpe’s work, “to attempt a socio-historical paraphrase is to experiment with the poetical work, to subject it to a hypothesis of its meanings. As in any scientific experiment with natural phenomena, the engagement with the ordinary phenomenon inevitably exposes the limits of the hypothesis, and ultimaely returns us to an even more acute sense of the phenomena we desire to understand. … By contrast,” their deformances “place primary emphasis on the preconceptual elements of the text” because “social and historical formations seem to us far less determinate, far more open to arbitrary and imaginative construction, than the appear in della Volpe” (Samuels &amp; McGann 48)
“‘Meaning’ is important not as explanation but as residue. It is what is left behing after the experiment has been run. We develop it not to explain the poem but to judge the effectiveness of the experiment we undertook.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 48)
“Only philosophers try to understand art. The point is to change it. Our actions on these works… allow us to begin to understand our thinking about them.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 49) 
“To essay a more direct application of ‘interpretation’ to poetical work runs the risk of suggesting that interpretation can be adequate to poiesis. It cannot; it can only run a thematic experiment withthe work, enlightening it by inadequacy and indirection. … one might rather look for interpretations that flaunt their subjectivity and arbitrariness” (Samuels &amp; McGann 49)
“To deliberately accept the inevitable failure of interpretive ‘adequacy’ is to work toward discovering new interpretive virtues… This attitude toward literate comprehension, and the kind of criticism it inspires, gains its power by baring its own devices.” (Samuels &amp; McGann 49)</Text>

            <Title>footnote for Rosalviva</Title>
            <Text>The two bibliographies’ treatments of Grenville Fletcher’s Rosalviva, Or, The Demon Dwarf, for example, serves as a useful illustration of their differences. Tracy’s summary is a litany of events: it begins matter-of-factly with the sentence “Leontini loves Viola di Morini, but she marries someone else,” and is equally unfazed when the titular dwarf arrives in the third act and when the dwarven appearance turns out to be false (51). Frank, in contrast, spends more than half his words on context, as in his first sentence: 
“From Rumplestilskin in the fairytale to the comic evil of Dickens’s Daniel Quilp in The Old Curiosity Shop (1841), the figure of the dwarf was often called upon to perform such demonic services as vengeance, prophecy, child possession, and transformation.” (107) 
To this broad literary history he adds Mary Shelley’s story “Transformation” as potential precursor for the disguise in Fletcher’s novel, and includes several assessments of the Gothic’s particular embellishments of “the dwarf as a resolver of dilemmas of identity” (107) and “dwarfs... spin[ning] webs of murderous intrigue for diabolic ladies” (108). All of these details stand in stark contrast to Tracy’s list of seven novels under the index entry “dwarf” (199), which treats the sinister disguise in Rosalviva as interchangeable with depictions of non-supernatural and even non-evil little people.</Text>

            <Title>Ramsay</Title>
            <Text>But "algorithmic criticism" — criticism prompted by the algorithmic manipulation of literary texts — either does not exist, or exists only in nascent form. The digital revolution, for all its wonders, has not penetrated the core activity of literary studies, which, despite numerous revolutions of a more epistemological nature, remains mostly concerned with the interpretive analysis of written cultural artifacts. Texts are browsed, searched, and disseminated by all but the most hardened Luddites in literary study, but seldom are they transformed algorithmically as a means of gaining entry to the deliberately and self-consciously subjective act of critical interpretation. Even text analysis practitioners avoid bringing the hermeneutical freedom of criticism to the "outputted" text. Bold statements, strong readings, and broad generalizations (to say nothing of radical misreadings, anarchic accusations, agonistic paratextual revolts) are rare, if not entirely absent from the literature of the field, where the emphasis is far more often placed on methodology and the limitations it imposes.


The computer is certainly incapable of offering "the shift to a redemptive world-view" as a solution to the problem at hand; it is wholly incapable of inferring this from the data. But is it likewise the case that computational results — the data and visualizations that the computer generates when it seeks to quantize and measure textual phenomena — cannot be used to engage in the sort of discussion that might lead one to such a conclusion?
It is useful to put the question this way, because in doing so we refocus the hermeneutical problem away from the nature and limits of computation (which is mostly a matter of methodology) and move it toward consideration of the nature of the discourse in which text analysis bids participation.



But in literary criticism — and here I am thinking of ordinary "paper based" literary criticism — conclusions are evaluated not in terms of what propositions the data allows, but in terms of the nature and depth of the discussions that result. The scientist is right to say that the plural of anecdote is not data, but in literary criticism, an abundance of anecdote is precisely what allows discussion and debate to move forward.


These are provocative results, but the provocation is as much about our sense of what we are doing (the hermeneutical question) as it is about how we are doing it (the methodological question).

If algorithmic criticism is to have a central hermeneutical tenet, it is this: that the narrowing constraints of computational logic — the irreducible tendency of the computer toward enumeration, measurement, and verification — are fully compatible with the goals of criticism set forth above. For while it is possible, and in some cases useful, to confine algorithmic procedures to the scientific realm, such procedures can be made to conform to the methodological project of inventio without transforming the nature of computation or limiting the rhetorical range of critical inquiry. This is possible, because critical reading practices already contain elements of the algorithmic.

Any reading of a text that is not a recapitulation of that text relies on a heuristic of radical transformation. The critic who endeavors to put forth a "reading," puts forth not the text, but a new text in which the data has been paraphrased, elaborated, selected, truncated, and transduced. This basic property of critical methodology is evident not only in the act of "close reading," but in the more ambitious project of thematic exegesis. In the classroom, one encounters the exegete instructing his or her students to turn to page 254, and then to page 16, and finally to page 400. They are told to consider just the male characters, or just the female ones, or to pay attention to the adjectives, the rhyme scheme, images of water, or the moment in which Nora Helmer confronts her husband. The interpreter will set a novel against the background of the Jacobite Rebellion, or a play amid the historical location of the theater. He or she will view the text through the lens of Marxism, or psychoanalysis, or existentialism, or postmodernism. In every case, what is being read is not the "original" text, but a text transformed and transduced into an alternative vision, in which, as Wittgenstein put it, we "see an aspect" that further enables discussion and debate.

It is not that such matters as redemptive world views and Marxist readings of texts can be arrived at algorithmically, but simply that algorithmic transformation can provide the alternative visions that give rise to such readings. The computer does this in a particularly useful way by carrying out transformations in a rigidly holistic manner. It is one thing to notice patterns of vocabulary, variations in line length, or images of darkness and light; it is another thing to employ a machine that can unerringly discover every instance of such features across a massive corpus of literary texts and then present those features in a visual format entirely foreign to the original organization in which these features appear. Or rather, it is the same thing at a different scale and with expanded powers of observation. It is in such results that the critic seek not facts, but patterns. And from pattern, the critic may move to the grander rhetorical formations that constitute critical reading.


 Algorithmic criticism would have to retain the commitment to methodological rigor demanded by its tools, but the emphasis would be less on maintaining a correspondence or a fitness between method and goal, and more on the need to present methods in a fully transparent manner. It would not be averse to the idea of reproducibility, but it would perhaps be even more committed to the notion of "hackability." For just as one might undertake a feminist reading of a text by transporting a set of heuristics from one critical context to another, so might the algorithmic critic undertake a particular type of reading by transforming a procedure that has been defined in terms of that most modern text, the computer program.
Algorithmic criticism undoubtedly requires a revolution of sorts, but that revolution is not one of new procedures and methods in contradistinction to the old ones. Algorithmic criticism seeks a new kind of audience for text analysis — one that is less concerned with fitness of method and the determination of interpretive boundaries, and one more concerned with evaluating the robustness of the discussion that a particular procedure annunciates. Such an audience exists, of course, and has existed for the better part of a century in the general community of literary critics from which text analysis has often found itself exiled. For this reason, text analysis practitioners should view the possibility of such a revolution as both welcome and liberating —not a critique of their methods, but a bold vote of confidence in the possibilities they hold.

            <Title>my model of Frank</Title>
            <Text>Adapting Frank’s model for my own, then, required working somewhat against the grain of his assumptions. However, I have avoided simply assigning each text one simple genre. Instead, I have separated out each strand of influence within his complex “Gothic types”  by dividing each “type” into a set of tags, and tallied the uses of each tag. This process generated 190 unique tags, most of which only applied to one or two works. By rendering the tags individually listable, my model imposes a more systematic ontology than Frank’s. However, because each work is “tagged” numerous times, my model retains the details of each work’s often-idiosyncratic combinations of influences. My approach treats each “tag” as an independent object of inquiry, informative on its own regarding one small facet of a work’s participation in its generic context. I ask whether the association of a given tag with a work constitutes meaningful information regarding the probable gender of that work’s author. Because Frank’s classifications are subjective assessments, an answer of “yes” to this question could have two meanings. When we find, for example, that the “sentimental” tag predicts female authorship, this could indicate either that women really did write more sentimental novels, or that certain common features of the Gothic are more likely to be called sentimental when women write them. Correlating genre tags with less ambiguous features of the work — such as the inclusion of particular motifs — will, later, allow us to examine to what extent Frank is responding to differences in authorial usage. But regardless of their basis, Frank’s assessments are informative about the horizon of critical expectations. Frank’s model of the multiplicity of Gothic subgenres, in the reverse of Tracy, shows an identifiable women’s Gothic, whereas the men’s Gothic is elusive.</Text>
            <Comments>First, Frank’s phrases were split so that each word became one tag. Radcliffe’s The Italian, listed as “Pure or high Gothic (terror and horror modes)” becomes “Pure”, “or”, “high”, “Gothic”, “terror”, “horror”, and “modes.” Then, conjunctions were deleted, and synonyms combined. Frank always uses the phrase “Pure or high” in its entirety, for example, so the tags “Pure”, “or”, and “high” were merged into one tag “Pure;high”. </Comments>

            <Text>Alex Wetmore, Men of Feeling in Eighteenth-Century Literature: Touching Fic- 
tion (Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave, 2013) 
“Alex Wetmore argues for the congruity between the printed bodies of sentimental books and the mechanized men of feeling presented within their pages.”
“Sentimental novels by Henry Brooke, laurence Sterne, tobias Smollett, and Henry Mackenzie are the focus of Men of Feeling”
“Wetmore introduces a useful term, “corporeal defamiliarization,” to denote how sentimental novels denaturalize their status as touchable book-objects.”
“Wetmore compellingly argues that sentimental self-consciousness can be understood to have the matter of the book and the body at its fraught center. Sentimental self-reflexivity, therefore, is not the metafictional, proto-postmodern irony that our moment in history might tempt us to identify it as being.”
“sentimental  fiction’s corporeal defamiliarization works in tandem with the genre’s palliative goal of expanding and extending nervous sensibilities.”
“Wetmore argues that toward the end of the century, the connective tissue binding sentimentality to self-referentiality was severed. newly suspicious approaches to sensibility are deployed in works across the political spectrum during this period: for example, Mary robinson’s The Natural Daughter (1799); Elizabeth Hamilton’s Memoirs of Modern Philosophers (1800); and robert Bage’s Hermsprong (1796). Each text reworks devices of corporeal defamiliarization deployed by Smollett, Mackenzie, and Sterne, respectively.”

            <Text>However, Frank’s model does point toward a [female] gendered tradition in Radcliffean and sentimental novels.

Nearly as strongly predictive of female authorship is the “sentimental” tag (92% female). [Tracy’s model was not sensitive to these features because they are not defined by individual plot devices.] [By looking at which Gothic types go together, a Female Gothic emerges.] Approaching from one direction, half of the Radcliffean novels are also high Gothic.

Of these nine, seven are by men. The ‘school of Radcliffe’ does thus appear to be a female-dominated school which stands in contrast to a smaller, less-distinct but male-dominated ‘school of Lewis’ — which raises the question of why neither Tracy’s motifs nor Frank’s horror and terror Gothic types showed evidence of these schools. </Text>

Gothic (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2014) 
“Once-dominant psychoanalytic and feminist interpretations have given way to critical work drawing on political and religious history, print culture studies, theories of media and remediation, and new formalism.”
“Edward Jacobs substantiates her role in establishing a new discursive mode: radcliffe’s “reproducible set of generic conventions” (52) cooperated with the cataloging practices of circulating libraries to form a readership inclined “to approach books less as unique texts than as members of genres””
“acobs claims in his informative chapter that radcliffe’s inclusion of poetry in her novels staged an opposition between two modes of reading: the “‘deep’, contemplative, repetitive reading” of “high” literary texts, and the super cial consumption of plot-driven entertainments associated with a “popular” and feminized media market”
 Dismissing the Gothic–romantic binary as a “hangover from the Victorians,” robert Miles develops the concept of a “popular romanticism” (117), in which radcliffe leaves unresolved the opposition between a disciplined, secular, and Enlightened modern subjectivity located in linear time and a porous premodern subjectivity “embedded in nature, which is animated, alive with spirits that effortlessly cross spatial and temporal boundaries”
in her chapter on how the ruined abbey in The Romance of the Forest represents “the historical and religious past that a modern, secularising culture was trying to bury” (100), Diane long hoeveler demonstrates her impressively extensive reading by citing parallels from obscure Gothic novels for the discovered manuscript topos, the villain who dies by poisoning himself, and the Gothic abbey as setting.

            <Text>"Temporary Failure of Mind": Déjà vu and Epilepsy in Radcliffe's 
The Mysteries of Udolpho 
Brandy Lain Schillace 
At the time The Mysteries of Udolpho was published, déjà vu had not been connected to epilepsy. Yet, as déjà vu routinely accompanies epileptic seizures, it is no surprise to find them linked in fiction, even if that link is not clinically explained; the disease and its symptoms pre-exist scientific authentication. Reading Udolpho with an understanding of the epileptic condition—its relationship to melancholy, its production of anxiety over self-boundaries and its mimicry of madness—opens new possibilities for gothic criticism. As a symptomatic text, The Mysteries of Udolpho connects manifestations of epilepsy to the Gothic's preoccupation with dreamy or altered states.
p.275: In its representations of the dreamy, the disorienting, and the doubled, The Mysteries of Udolpho explores not the supernatural, but the psychological and the neurological. Reading Udolpho with an understanding of the epileptic condition—its relationship to melancholy, its production of anxiety over self-boundaries and its mimicry of madness—opens new possibilities for gothic criticism. By exploring current and eighteenth-century understandings of epilepsy and its auras, and by reading Emily as an epileptic subject designed to court the empathy and identi cation of her readers, we see how Radcliffe’s most terrifying horrors are those that threaten the mind and lead to the dissolution of the self. -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017

p.287: Our own lingering interest in the Gothic suggests a way in which participation in literature, gothic or otherwise, forces us to confront the disorienting spectralization not of others but of ourselves—and it is we as readers who crave, even more than Emily herself, the “suspense that enthrall[s] the vulgar” -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017</Text>

"No Colour of Language": Radcliffe's Aesthetic Unbound 
This essay reads Ann Radcliffe's celebrated landscapes in light of their remarkable infusion with "every colour that paints the rainbow"—an infusion that links Radcliffe's gothic fictions with contemporary aesthetic theory. But that theory often doubled as a kind of early speech act theory, and against its background, I argue, Radcliffe's colors emerge as a mode and method of signaling the presence and politics of linguistic mediation. Radcliffe herself identifies "tint" and "hue" with the ever-inadequate "colours of language," allowing us to read Radcliffe's landscapes as subversive pictures of nothing but the (here feminine) perception that frames them.
“It is a pity that Ann Radcliffe’s “language” should so often lament its own insufficiency of “colour,” when color is one of the qualities that most vividly distinguishes her prose fiction from that of virtually all of her predecessors and contemporaries.”
“Here, I would like to approach these complementary effects of abstraction and coloration as fundamentally linguistic devices which in Radcliffe’s hands find themselves further filtered through the scrim of specifically feminine perception.”
p.386: In all their “rich colouring” (SR 104), Radcliffe’s landscapes cannot in truth be said to consist in more than the “beauties and effects” of the English language; in an importantly literal sense, there is nothing more to them. -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017
p.387: Just so, when we turn to Radcliffe’s use of specific “hue[s]” to enhance her scenery, we often find color detaching itself from material bodies, not to abandon them but to span the chasm that apparently divides those bodies from ideal forms and values. -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017
p.389: Because the descriptions she derived from those authorities aim to make us see nothing through them, but everything in them, they sabotage their own pictorial pretensions. This amounts to true aesthetic critique, even as it challenges from within a culturally cherished superstition about written language -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017
p.389: Thus obsessively repeated textual “effects” like light’s dissolution into mist, or its refraction into color, are not in themselves merely slavish reflections of Burke’s sublime, Reynolds’s abstraction, or for that matter, the Newtonian optics from which both of these ideals were derived. Rather, such Radcliffean signatures trace—indeed literalize—the circumstances under which aesthetic figure and cultural ground become one. -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017</Text>

p.616: The terrific flood of books about the gothic novel continues unabated. A vastly popular mode of undisputed resonance and influence offers great opportunity to scholars of enterprise and energy.  -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017
p.617:p.616: Watt, the more political of the two scholars, assesses the labels that might be applied to different writers; Gamer, the more formalist (as his subtitle reflects), focuses more on moral and psychological atti- --  tudes. Both studies regard authors as speaking within and to their immediately contemporary circles -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017
p.617: both books lack the political passion of David Punter or the psychological intensity motivating both New Critical readings (Robert Kiely’s Romantic Novel in England, still the best in this line, remains unmentioned) and the subsequent Freudian and post-Freudian work of Eve Sedgwick and Terry Castle. The literature of (German) terror is now a garden of (English) delight. -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017
p.617: The depth of Watt’s and Gamer’s research persuades me that on historical grounds they are basically right and will help set gothic studies in a calmer view. -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017
p.617: Whether the gothic is best seen with this kind of wide-eyed clarity is an open question. There is a New Positivism in these books that wants settled truths and definitions. -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017
p.617: Watt is a nominalist. His governing premise is that the gothic is manifold: “The Gothic romance is a hybrid genre, its diverse affiliations best understood by way of detailed case studies of authors, works, and publishing events, and via a focus on the kinds of classification made by contemporary critics and reviewers” -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017
p.617: Watt unearths a popular tradition of stories of recovered order and restored houses. Even though the narratives are only intermittently or glancingly gothic, they form an important context for the plot structures of better-known works. -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017
Still, it is easier to feel more respect than enthusiasm for so level-headed a book. In taking its evidence apart, nominalism loses its thrust. The book dis- solves into its object, becoming itself the recuperative loyalist romance that it finds in its materials. Diversity turns out to be the mark of drift; nothing has the power to upset the apple-cart, and the wagon rolls onward, albeit unevenly, to- ward its market reward. The four featured authors exhibit in different flavors a common tendency to retreat from commitment into irresponsibility or consola- tion. Nothing too frightening endures. 
Consequently, the book is perhaps most useful in provoking a response. Its critique lays the groundwork for a defense of the gothic. 
Gamer follows (and acknowledges) Watt in arguing for the diversity of the gothic. “I define the gothic neither as a mode nor as a kind of fiction (the ‘gothic novel’) but . . . as a ‘shifting’ aesthetic” (4). Objecting to Fredric Jame- son’s conception of genre as ideology, he stresses “gothic’s ideological flexibility” and “mutability” (45, 51). He gives shape to the flux by configuring it in terms of more settled oppositions such as masculine and feminine, elite and popular, ma- ture and adolescent, modern and antique, real and romantic. An insistence on contradiction gives positioning precedence over invention. 
p.621: What is the gothic? That is the core question neither of these books really even poses. (Perhaps they are too impressed by Robert Miles’s Gothic Writing, 1750–1820: A Genealogy [London: Routledge, 1993], which says (p. 4) that gothic is an “ambiguous, shifting term, but then the textual phenomena to which it points are shifting and ambiguous.” -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017
p.622: Neither book here sufficiently distinguishes the popular German ghost stories from the better novels that departed from them. Mary Shelley and her companions read one of those books on a rainy afternoon, and she wrote Frankenstein in response. But though she calls it a “ghost story,” it transparently isn’t one. -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017
p.622: For surely, even as they sought the approbation of readers and reviewers to dignify their enterprise, writers also had to endow their works with a content and a purpose.  -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017
p.622: Gamer, like Watt, has written an account of prosaic gothic that will stand as a valuable prolegomenon to a study of the poetic richness of gothic meanings. -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017

Batchelor investigates how women thought about their literary labors and how these perceptions evolved over the course of the century. Both books seek to augment traditionally male-centered literary history and to provide new ways of understanding the contribution of gender to the construction of the novel. -- Highlighted Apr 21, 2017

Page 3
In the decades during which Smith was writing, Batchelor reminds us, literary careers were being professionalized (as can be seen in debates over copyright and the rise of literary reviews) as well as masculinized. Smith’s response to this cultural shift was to emphasize in her prefaces, footnotes, and semi-autobiographical plots the domestic labor that “both occasioned and impeded her literary career” (91), and to insist upon what hard work it all was.

Batchelor’s careful tracking of the way in which the discourse of literary authorship came to reinforce the social constructions of gender will help us to historicize what we know about women writers, and to reinterpret what they said about their authorial labors.

            <Text>I don’t think the question of defining the gothic is interesting… or do I?
I definitely don’t want to undertake definition through individual monumental works. I think it’s partly historical happenstance that we have canonized the particular works that we have
(I’m thinking here about The Making of a Marchioness, and the way that this third-tier Burnett has become so rich and important to me; there are surely reasons that it’s not as enormously popular as A Little Princess, and indeed that The Secret Garden beats out A Little Princess too, but — those reasons aren’t, I don’t think, due entirely to literary superiority. There are other things too.)
Implicitly I see the Gothic defined as “stuff that other people looked at and thought was Gothic enough to jot down” — and I see the next step to be seeking continuities within the works and connections/“synergies” between the criticism. 
(I DEFINITELY need to combine Frank &amp; Tracy to get at this point though — e.g., what motifs are most predictive of the sentimental? Of horror? What kinds of stories have subterannean passages?) — I can do that with pivot tables in Google Sheets</Text>

            <Text>My theoretical approach emphasizes the continuities between computational approaches to literature and the the venerable tradition of archival bibliographical research. Heather Love has notably turned to sociological microanalysis as a model for 'thin description' close-but-not-deep reading methods; I employ qualitative computational modelling as another method which seeks the same goals. Love emphasizes thin description as not just “fine-grained” but “exhaustive” (and possibly exhausting) but with the reward that “one could—at least ideally—pay equal attention to every aspect … and record it faithfully.”  I add to this that good descriptions offer themselves up for reuse and recombination, by rendering somehow graspable that which they describe. Downplaying the importance of close interpretation, Love says that “Good descriptions … account for the real variety that is already there.” It is the work of accounting for real variety that both bibliography and computation demand: the system must have a way to cope with odd cases. Even if one simply makes an exception to otherwise-established rules, or adds an expanatory footnote or a comment within one’s code, outliers must be acknowledged and grappled with. I use computational interventions to interrogate the literary models represented in two older bibliographies. In so doing, I argue, I demonstrate the utility of qualitative description, as a promising avenue toward revisiting older scholarships and re-forging connections with the work that has come before.</Text>

            <Text>Ordering’ Novels: Describing Prose Fiction, 1770–1832
Peter Garside 
The Oxford Handbook of the Eighteenth-Century Novel 
This essay considers the way in which various types of fiction were projected at their original readers, primarily through the title pages, but also through reviews and circulating-library catalogues. Increasing use was made of ‘Novel’, ‘Romance’, and ‘Tale’ as main descriptors, with Novel gradually gaining prominence in the later eighteenth century, Romance enjoying a moment of popularity round the turn of the century, and Tale or Tales achieving ascendancy by the 1820s. Additional components in titles, such as the Sentimental, Gothic, and Historical, helped communicate different subgeneric types of fiction. Eventually, a three-tiered system stretched from ‘common’ circulating fiction to novels of reputation, the latter signalled by the use of the larger octavo format and through the development of distinct author identities (even when published anonymously). The Magnum Opus collected edition of Scott’s novels made him a classic in his time, finally establishing the novel as a fully established genre. 
p.2: In more recent years an interest in specific fields, notably Gothic and women’s studies, has led to a number of advances being made, albeit in ways which sometimes arguably have the effect of highlighting to the point of exaggeration, while risking further obfuscation of other (often interrelating) modes -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.2: Owing to a major bibliographical breakthrough, it is now possible to cover that territory more fully, over the full timespan in question, and in ways which potentially take us closer to earlier forms of ordering fictional output -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.2: The transcription of details from original title pages among other things allows a much clearer view of the ways in which novels were first projected at their readers: all entries include the full title given to the work, the imprint of the original publisher(s), and unmediated information as to how authorship was first signified. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017 &lt;— Garside’s model
the novels included … for the years 1770–1832 amount to 3,958 titles

Naming the Form 
p.4: During this period three descriptive labels, ‘Novel’, ‘Romance’, and ‘Tale(s)’ eventually became predominant, as illustrated in Figure 23.1, showing their percentage usage relative to total output of new titles annually. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
#
p.4: In the earlier eighteenth century the term ‘Novel’ appears to have been most commonly applied to shorter works, chiefly of an amatory nature, many of these being translations from French. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017 p.4:  None of the ‘classic’ male English fictions of the mid-century appears to have described itself as a Novel in its titles. The term is, however, found in a number of single female domestic fictions between 1720 and 1750 -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017  p.4: distinct shift is noticeable in 1769, with five new titles including the term, of which four are two-volume productions -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017   p.4: It is only during the later 1780s, at a time of accelerating production (see Figure 23.2), that ‘Novel’ becomes fully established as a term, with nearly half of new titles in the year 1785 (twenty-three out of forty-seven) featuring it as a main generic denominator, often in alliance with an indication of epistolary content -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017   p.5: The subsequent decline in the use of the term, with just 15 per cent of new works in the 1820s calling themselves novels, is a complex matter, intimately connected with the alternative labels of ‘Romance’ and ‘Tale(s)’ -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.5:  any practical use of Romance in the titling of new fiction is rare for much of the later eighteenth century, with less than ten new novels featuring the termin their titles between 1770 and 1789, representing barely 1 per cent of output -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017          p.6: The optimum point occurs during the years 1809–11, when nearly 25 per cent of new titles called themselves romances. This, however, was followed by a sharp decline in 1813–15, the time of Walter Scott’s advent as a novelist, leading to a fairly steady petering out thereafter, with ‘Romance’ taking third place behind ‘Novel’ and ‘Tale(s)’ in all but one year to 1832 -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.6: The use of the term ‘Tale(s)’ to distinguish both single items and multiple collections was relatively well established by 1770 -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017     p.6: The use of ‘Tale(s)’ for substantial single works of fiction becomes more common in the 1780s and 1790s, when at certain high points as many as 20 per cent of new titles described themselves this way. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017    p.6: the label appears to have acted as a magnet for authors wishing to accentuate the un-novel-like natural qualities of their works -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017     p.6: One telling feature of the 1790s is the more frequent use of ‘Tale’ in relation to a growing number of ‘German’ titles (as in ‘A Tale, From the German’), whereas in the case of French counterparts the choice of ‘Novel’ would be more usual -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.7: It is also possible to discern distinct patterns amongst individual authors, indicating a more than arbitrary adoption of the main terms available -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017      p.7: authors and/or their publishers shifting judiciously between the three terms, sometimes as a reflection of length, but also as a means of denoting the nature of content -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017      p.7: It is equally true that generic labels could be bandied around fairly arbitrarily onoccasions. Some titles indicate unwillingness on the part of the author to be tied down byany of them -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.8: circulating library catalogues, where the baggier subheadings used by the longer-established libraries, such as ‘Novels, Romances, Imaginary Histories, Lives, and Adventures’, generally give way to tighter versions, expanding no further than ‘Novels, Tales, and Romances’. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.8: tendency at the end of our period for novels to include no main generic label at all -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017   p.8: the genre no longer needed to engage so much in selfidentification. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

The Growth of Subgenres 
p.8: The development of a number of distinctive subgenres of fiction, notably during the period of high production in the later 1780s and 1790s, helped make titles more crucial than ever in directing readers towards their favourite kind of reading, or in tempting them to try ‘something new’ -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

p.8: One of the most durable over the period proved to be ‘Domestic’ -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

p.9: a steady decline in the flow of new fiction offering a picaresque and/or bawdy content. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

p.9: One effect of the decline of an older kind of peripatetic narrative, however, was to allow fuller exposure to a species of object-centred ‘It-narratives’, centring on inanimate objects, after the fashion of Charles Johnstone’s Chrysal; or, The Adventures of a Guinea (1760–5) -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017 ….. p.9: Combining with a version of the equally long-standing ‘secret history’, in which the follies of society are exposed from the perspective of supposedly ingenuous observer, this mode of writing also comes into view again during the scandalous days of the Regency -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

p.9: One of the most potent phrases found in fiction of the later eighteenth century is ‘In A Series of Letters’ -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017     p.10: a strong conjunction with novels also proclaiming their ‘sentimental’ credentials -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.10: Coexisting with this mode there is the more intense ‘sensibility’ school of fiction, stimulated by translations of Rousseau’s Nouvelle Héloïse (1761) and Goethe’s Werther (1774), though numerically this always represented a minority field -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

p.10: As a whole the optimum period for the production of sentimental novels in English appears to have been between 1787 and 1790, when at least 30 per cent of new titles are categorizable as belonging to this mode. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

p.10: Although historians of the Gothic have claimed a fairly unbroken genealogy from Walpole’s Castle of Otranto (first issued 1764; subtitled ‘A Gothic Story’ in its second edition of 1765) to late exponents such as Radcliffe and Lewis, the fully-fledged Gothic romance only really coalesced as a recognizable form in the later 1790s, absorbing in the process several characteristics of the sentimental novel. 
p.10:  In terms of density of production the optimum years for the mode were between 1794 and 1807, with at points over a third of new titles exhibiting Gothic characteristics. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

p.11: A combination of ‘Romance’ with a number of other keywords, including ‘Cavern’, ‘Forest’, and ‘Abbey’, would likewise have pointed to a Gothic novel in the relatively decorous Radcliffeian ‘terror’ tradition.  -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.11: In contrast, titles following the ‘horror’ school of M. G. Lewis’s The Monk, characterized by its sadism and voyeurism, tend to be far more aggressive in their nomenclature, with visible ghosts and demons upstaging haunting spirits, brutal robbers outnumbering banditti, and nunneries supplanting convents. Not surprisingly, ‘Monk’ is the most common signifier by far, appearing in a leading position in some fifteen titles, with the greatest concentration between 1802 and 1809. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.11: In a few instances, titles jumble together Radcliffeian and Lewisian components, as in T. J. Horsley Curties’s The Monk of Udolpho (1807), whose naming (Curties claimed in his foreword) had been largely determined by the priorities of his publisher, J. F. Hughes -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

p.11: Another noticeable feature of the years leading up the publication of Scott’s Waverley (1814) is the large number of novels claiming to be historical fictions, an aspect of literary (p. 399) output which until recently has been relatively ignored. In fact, in its time, perhaps no other subgenre made a greater effort through titling to make its presence known -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017       p.11: Between 1786 and 1814 some seventy titles can be found describing themselves as Historic(al) Novels, Romances, or Tales -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.11: Admittedly some of the earlier of these novels can on examination prove to be little more than sentimental or Gothic-type fictions in period costume; while in the early 1810s especially there are instances of the mode being appropriated as a fairly thin veil for contemporary scandalous matter. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.12: Another interesting feature of this mode is its original willingness to appear under all three main generic labels. Between 1800 and 1814, however, ‘Romance’ became by far the main descriptor.  -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

p.12: At this point, the historical romance (though largely overwritten by subsequent developments) stood in a much stronger position than both sentimental and Gothic novels, themselves eventually outnumbered even by their parodies, and either absorbed into other modes or, in unmediated form, consigned to the lower ‘trade’ end of the market. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017


‘High’ and ‘Low’ Fiction 
p.13:  Early review notices indicate a fairly pervasive recognition that a golden age of novel-writing had been succeeded with one marked by mediocrity, and not infrequently new novels are viewed as being imitative of past masters such as Richardson while lacking their creative spark. At the same time, there is rarely any indication of the possibility of descent beyond the second-rate -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.13: A distinct shift in this situation, however, becomes noticeable from the later 1780s, following a large surge in production. One fairly immediate sign is a new impatience bordering on intolerance to be found in the established monthly reviews, still committed to commenting, however briefly, on all titles issued by the London trade. Symptomatic of this is a new tendency to figure novels in metaphorically grotesque terms -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017  p.13: three-tier system of grading, with those works picked out for special praise usually being consigned to second-rate status, ahead of the morass of ‘common’ novels -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.13: With the next surge of production in the later 1790s the system of comprehensive reviewing was stretched to breaking point, making the policy of all-inclusion well-nigh untenable -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.14: the gap between circulating library fiction and more upmarket products was by no means as clear as it would become by the 1820s. William Lane of the Minerva Press, for example, included novels by Godwin and Bage in his earlier lists, and was capable on occasions of producing items similar to those at the higher ‘carriage-trade’ end of the market -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.14: Another sign of the prominence achieved by authors such as Mackenzie and Burney is the large number of imitations generated in their wake -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.14: the heady post-Revolutionary ideological climate, which gave fresh purpose to the sentimental novel -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

Histories of the novel:
p.15: Godwin’s Things As They Are (1794), according to its Critical reviewer, ranked ‘greatly above the whole mass of publications which bear the name of novels’, excepting perhaps ‘the productions of Fielding, Smollet [sic], and Burney’.13 The inclusion here of Burney matches a tendency at this stage for more general observers to link different generations of novelists with some degree of equality -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.15: A parallel realignment of the canon is also perceptible in novels such as Robert Bisset’s reactionary Douglas; or, The Highlander (1800), with Fielding granted precedence over Richardson, Burney being separated off from Radcliffe and Smith, and Godwin and his circle excoriated out of existence in the most violent of personal attacks. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

p.15: The early 1800s show the reputation of fiction at one of its lowest points. At the same time, as a form of popular reading matter the genre by now was palpably unstoppable, with an optimum peak of 111 new titles being reached in 1808 -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.15: The idea that fiction had reached an absolute nadir, demanding radical reformation, can be found in a number of key texts at this point. One major intervention came in the form of Hannah More’s evangelical Cœlebs in Search of a Wife (1808) -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

p.15: Scott skims a thin layer of ‘insipid’ sentimental fictions, before biting on the new scurrility: ‘we have now the lowest denizens of Grub-street narrating, under the flimsy veil of false names, and through the medium of a fictitious tale, all that malevolence can invent (p. 403) and stupidity propagate’. Delving further, he confronts a number of formulaic imitations of Radcliffe and Lewis, amidst which the Fatal Revenge stands out as the product of a gifted, if misdirected, writer.16 -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.16: The introductory sequence, mockingly speculating possible subtitles, parallels the Maturin review in proceeding through the Radcliffeian Gothic (‘a castle scarce less than that of Udolpho, of which the eastern wing has been long uninhabited’), a more Lewisian ‘Romance from the German’, a ‘Sentimental Tale’ (‘sufficient presage of a heroine with a profusion of auburn hair, and a harp’), and a ‘A Tale of the Times’ ( ‘a dashing sketch of the fashionable world, a few anecdotes of private scandal thinly veiled’).18 Eschewing such possibilities, Scott then settles on a tale of men and manners, set just within living memory, adopting at first a narrative tone strongly reminiscent of Fielding -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

p.17: In bearing the lead title of Waverley Novels on its spine labels and title pages this employed the same mantle descriptive term as the main body of post-1774 collected sets of ‘classic’ fiction -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.17: As such it offered infallible proof that the genre, collectively known as the novel, had now in its contemporary form come to full fruition. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017</Text>

            <Text>Current study of gender and the early Gothic is sophisticated at the expense of examining few texts. This paper examines hundreds of popular pre-Victorian Gothic works to ask whether female writers created categorically different works than their male peers. Two qualitative bibliographies of the Gothic provide “motifs” and “Gothic types” for computational modelling. In these models, male and female schools do indeed exist, but that they do not map neatly to a set of female/male terror/horror Radcliffe/Lewis binaries, and both gendered schools are dwarfed by a non-gendered Gothic mainstream.</Text>

            <Title>lit review: female gothic</Title>
            <Text>Scholarly inquiry into the impact of gender on the emergence of the Gothic novel in the late eighteenth century has grown increasingly nuanced. At its inception and for most of its literary history, criticism of Gothic emotional excess or implausible machinery generally went hand-in-hand with dismissals of the genre as unserious due to its percieved alignment with women. In the 1980s, feminist critics like Juliann Fleenor enabled the “Female Gothic”, defined as Gothic works “written and consistently read by women”, to stand as a worthy object of study regardless of the individual works’ literary qualities due to their direct relationships to a patriarchal paradigm and their ability “to express the conflict for which patriarchy has no name”. Contemporary critics have turned their attention from relationships between women and their world to relationships between texts. This shift is exemplified in Robert Miles’s sophisticated reading of Ann Radcliffe and Matthew Lewis’s works as making use of both “Female Gothic” and “Male Gothic” “narrative grammar”. My interest is in something less fine-grained: not the exemplary literary aesthetic of the Female Gothic, but the popular phenomenon of a women’s Gothic.</Text>

            <Title>women's Gothic</Title>
            <Text>Instead, in this model of the genre, the women’s Gothic seems to be defined by only four things: libertines (64% female), forced weddings (62% female), sad or pious deaths (61% female), and miniature portraits (61% female). The libertines and miniature portraits in particular, as the most common female motifs, immediately suggest a women’s Gothic that is in striking conversation with novels like Jane Austen’s, whose ordered and rational novels are nonetheless repelete with rakes and miniatures. Or, looking at their prominence in the top ten for each of these tropes, one might be tempted to investigate Regina Maria Roche and Louisa Sidney Stanhope as the unexpected representatives of the women’s Gothic. However, narrow margin of [dominance] for each motif suggests that defining a genre here may be too hasty. The male motifs represented a variety of elements used by many different men, such that no one author could be responsible for its gendered uptake. These female motifs are far less robust: if we ignore either Roche or Stanhope, we are down to just two female-dominated motifs, and if we ignore both, we are left with zero. When it comes to the inclusion of particular story elements, then, this women’s Gothic is outnumbered not just by the men’s Gothic but also by the mainstream Gothic.</Text>

            <Title>Author Guidelines</Title>
            <Text>The editors invite contributions on all aspects of the eighteenth century. Essays employing interdisciplinary perspectives or addressing contemporary theoretical and cultural concerns relating to the eighteenth century are especially encouraged. Articles which are selected for publication are those which make a significant and original contribution to their field. The editors also invite submission of previously unpublished or little-known primary sources, with translation or commentary.
Article submissions are first screened for their appropriateness for the journal. Articles which are considered for publication are sent to two reviewers: one reviewer, generally drawn from the author’s home discipline, serves as a specialist in the subject matter at hand while the other, generally drawn from a second discipline, approaches the article from a broader thematic perspective. Based on these initial reviewers’ reports, the article is either rejected, returned for revisions, or passed on to the editorial board for another level of review.  Once in the hands of the editorial board, each article is read by at least one additional reviewer. These editorial board reviewers make publishing recommendations to the editor, who makes the final decision regarding publication.
Manuscripts should not exceed 7,500 words, including notes. Style must conform to The Chicago Manual of Style 16th edition, with endnotes. Quotations from foreign texts should appear in the body of the essay followed by translations. Please supply an abstract of 100 or fewer words with your paper. Illustrations are accepted if pertinent to the essay (authors must secure glossy prints or digital files and reproduction rights if the essay is accepted). It is the journal's policy to require assignment of copyright from all authors. Authors must obtain written permission for quoting unpublished or published material in excess of fair use.</Text>

            <Text>“Quantitative gains in the amount of scholarly data available and accessible are with certain qualifications a Good Thing — but not the essential thing.”
“work that is disciplined, i.e., distinguishable from the intelligent but unreliable opinion of the educated layperson.”
“a common epistemological sense: use of a likeness to gain knowledge of its original.”
“We can see immediately why computing should be spoken of in these terms, as it represents knowledge of things in manipulable form”
“My argument is that we can learn from what philosophers and historians have had to say about experimental practice in the natural sciences because humanities computing is, like them, an equipment-oriented field of enquiry. It thus provides, I will suggest later, access to a common ground of concerns.”
“The most basic distinction is, in Clifford Geertz's terms, between "an 'of' sense and a 'for' sense" of modeling (1993/1973: 93). A model of something is an exploratory device, a more or less "poor substitute" for the real thing (Groenewold 1961: 98). We build such modelsof because the object of study is inaccessible or intractable, like poetry or subatomic whatever theyare. In contrast a model for something is a design, exemplary ideal, archetype or other guiding preconception. Thus we construct a model of an airplane in order to see how it works; we design a model for an airplane to guide its construction. A crucial point is that both kinds are imagined, the former out of a preexisting reality, the latter into a world that doesn't yet exist, as a plan for its realization.”
“comprise a practical means of playing out the consequences of an idea in the real world”
“a model of is made in a consciously simplifying act of interpretation. Although this kind of model is not necessarily a physical object, the goal of simplification is to make tractable or manipulable what the modeler regards as interesting about it.”
“A fundamental principle for modelingof is the exact correspondence between model and object with respect to the webs of relationships among the selected elements in each. Nevertheless, such isomorphism (as it is called) may be violated deliberately in order to study the consequences”
“a modelof is fictional not only by being a representation, and so not the thing itself, but also by selective omission and perhaps by distortion and inclusion as well”
“Shanin notes that modeling may be useful, appropriate, stimulating, and significant — but by definition never true (1972: 11). It is, again, a pragmatic strategy for coming to know”
“collapses the distinction between theory and theoretical model, leaving us to deal only with varieties of modeling”
“Since modeling is pragmatic, the worth of a model must be judged by its fruitfulness.”
“that for a modelof, this fruitfulness is meaningful in proportion to the "goodness of the fit" between model and original”
“as a bridge between theory and empirical data, the model participates in both”
“a good model can be fruitful in two ways: either by fulfilling our expectations, and so strengthening its theoretical basis, or by violating them, and so bringing that basis into question”
“I argue that from the research perspective of the model, in the context of the humanities, failure to give us what we expect is by far the more important result, however unwelcome surprises may be to granting agencies.”
“Driven as we are by the epistemological imperative, to know; constrained (as in Plato's cave or before St Paul's enigmatic mirror) to know only poor simulacra of an unreachable reality — but aware somehow that they are shadows of something — our faith is that as the shadowing (or call it modeling) gets better, it approaches the metaphorical discourse of the poets.”
“The imaginative language of poetry doesn't survive well under such a regime. But this is only what we expect from modeling, during which (as Teodor Shanin said) the "limited and selective consciousness" of the modeler comes up against "the unlimited complexity and 'richness' of the object."”
“It assumes a transcendent, imperfectly accessible reality for the artifacts we study, recognizes the central role of tacit knowledge in humanistic ways of knowing them and, while giving us unprecedented means for systematizing these ways, is pragmatically antirealist about them.”
“Its fruits are manipulatory control of the”“modeled data and, by reducing the reducible to mechanical form, identification of new horizons for research.”</Text>

tendency at the end of our period for novels to include no main generic label at all … the genre no longer needed to engage so much in selfidentification.

The early 1800s show the reputation of fiction at one of its lowest points. At the same time, as a form of popular reading matter the genre by now was palpably unstoppable, with an optimum peak of 111 new titles being reached in 1808
In bearing the lead title of Waverley Novels on its spine labels and title pages this employed the same mantle descriptive term as the main body of post-1774 collected sets of ‘classic’ fiction. As such it offered infallible proof that the genre, collectively known as the novel, had now in its contemporary form come to full fruition.


These important and magnificent volumes will shape the literary history and criticism of the English Romantic novel and of English Ro- manticism for years to come. All readers will immediately recognize them as the standard bibliography of British novels from 1770 to 1829.

            <Text>Dear Mr. Evalyn,

Thank you for your enquiry.  It generally takes about a week, sometimes less, for initial review, when the editor and I read a submission and decide whether to send it out for review.  We don’t currently have any CFPs out for special issues.  We do indeed accept illustrations; unfortunately, we don’t currently print in color.  You might look at Michael Gavin’s recent article in 50.1, “Historical Text Networks.”  He was able to create enough difference in grayscale to make the distinctions clear on his graphs.  We have some flexibility in terms of number of figures; we’d prefer not to exceed around 10, but that isn’t a hard-and-fast number.  Please let me know if I can answer any further questions, and thank you once again for your interest in ECS.

Sincerely,

Amy Dunagin

            <Title>mainstream Gothic</Title>
            <Text>More than half of the motifs under consideration are not strongly gendered in either direction. Four are even perfect ties: elopement (all subcategories); dueling and other single combat; fainting, female; and rediscovery of lost relatives. Moreover, the more popular a motif is — that is, the larger a role it plays in constituting the default expectations of the genre — the more likely it is to be non-gendered. Indeed, all of the strongly male-dominated motifs are much less common than the more neutral motifs. The neutrality of the most popular motifs is essentially a mathematical inevitability: nothing can achieve more than 50% popularity while being used by only 50% of authors. The Gothic mainstream must be defined by that which is available to all authors within the genre. In terms of sheer prevalence, the defining features of the Gothic appear to be fainting (present in 77% of all novels), confinement (66% of novels), abduction (57%), references to suicide (47%), and storms (44%). Only one of those five motifs, suicide (61% male), shows hints of a gendered divide.</Text>
            <Comments>That is, the defining features of the Gothic which nonetheless struck Ann Tracy as singular enough to be worth indexing — castles, for example, might have topped this list, if they hadn’t been considered too common to index. However, convents, ghosts, and corpses were all in the running for defining motifs, but were insuffiiently prevalent.</Comments>

            <Title>this CRIES OUT for correlation</Title>
            <Text>Attempting to compare the two models raises the prospect of combining them. It’s been an open question to this point whether Frank’s Gothic types respond to actually gendered usage, or impose their interpretations based on subsequent gendered expectation. When it comes to assessing a work as “polemical” versus “didactic”, for example, the tone difference is a subjective interpretation which could easily be influenced by his knowledge of the author’s gender. In contrast, Tracy’s boolean motifs — although they may be prone to false negatives, and are certainly vague in interpretive detail — are at least safe from these interpretive false positives. We can thus evaluate the potentially-gendered basis of Frank’s type assessments by considering the motifs associated with each tag. Because, as we saw earlier, Tracy’s motifs only render certain kinds of literary features visible, we are now doubly prone to false negatives. However, we can still hope for some true positives. In correlating the two bibliographies, I narrow my attention to the 178 texts included in both works, and ask: does knowing Frank gave a work a certain tag tell us anything about what motifs it probably has? In particular, can the “horror” and “terror” tags be distinguished from each other and from the mainstream by particular motifs?</Text>

            <Title>the sentimental &amp; the Gothic</Title>
            <Text>Sentimental
One of the most potent phrases found in fiction of the later eighteenth century is ‘In A Series of Letters’ … a strong conjunction with novels also proclaiming their ‘sentimental’ credentials
Coexisting with this mode there is the more intense ‘sensibility’ school of fiction, stimulated by translations of Rousseau’s Nouvelle Héloïse (1761) and Goethe’s Werther (1774), though numerically this always represented a minority field
As a whole the optimum period for the production of sentimental novels in English appears to have been between 1787 and 1790, when at least 30 per cent of new titles are categorizable as belonging to this mode.
the heady post-Revolutionary ideological climate, which gave fresh purpose to the sentimental novel

Gothic
Although historians of the Gothic have claimed a fairly unbroken genealogy from Walpole’s Castle of Otranto (first issued 1764; subtitled ‘A Gothic Story’ in its second edition of 1765) to late exponents such as Radcliffe and Lewis, the fully-fledged Gothic romance only really coalesced as a recognizable form in the later 1790s, absorbing in the process several characteristics of the sentimental novel.
In terms of density of production the optimum years for the mode were between 1794 and 1807, with at points over a third of new titles exhibiting Gothic characteristics.
A combination of ‘Romance’ with a number of other keywords, including ‘Cavern’, ‘Forest’, and ‘Abbey’, would likewise have pointed to a Gothic novel in the relatively decorous Radcliffeian ‘terror’ tradition.
In contrast, titles following the ‘horror’ school of M. G. Lewis’s The Monk, characterized by its sadism and voyeurism, tend to be far more aggressive in their nomenclature, with visible ghosts and demons upstaging haunting spirits, brutal robbers outnumbering banditti, and nunneries supplanting convents. Not surprisingly, ‘Monk’ is the most common signifier by far, appearing in a leading position in some fifteen titles, with the greatest concentration between 1802 and 1809.
In a few instances, titles jumble together Radcliffeian and Lewisian components, as in T. J. Horsley Curties’s The Monk of Udolpho (1807), whose naming (Curties claimed in his foreword) had been largely determined by the priorities of his publisher, J. F. Hughes

Historical
Another noticeable feature of the years leading up the publication of Scott’s Waverley (1814) is the large number of novels claiming to be historical fictions, an aspect of literary (p. 399) output which until recently has been relatively ignored.
Admittedly some of the earlier of these novels can on examination prove to be little more than sentimental or Gothic-type fictions in period costume; while in the early 1810s especially there are instances of the mode being appropriated as a fairly thin veil for contemporary scandalous matter.
At this point, the historical romance (though largely overwritten by subsequent developments) stood in a much stronger position than both sentimental and Gothic novels, themselves eventually outnumbered even by their parodies, and either absorbed into other modes or, in unmediated form, consigned to the lower ‘trade’ end of the market.</Text>

            <Title>no binaries</Title>
            <Text>This motif-based model of the early Gothic suggests that, rather than a balanced oppositions of Radcliffe’s female terror Gothic versus Lewis’s male horror Gothic, the genre as a popular movement was defined by a less-sensationalist (possibly Radcliffean, possibly terror-mode) non-genered Gothic mainstream, with a subset of male horror Gothic writers making up a minor tradition within it. These results serve as a useful reminder that not all contrasts are perfect binaries; the existence of a men’s Gothic tradition does not require that everything outside that tradition be a perfectly-opposed women’s Gothic.</Text>

p.3: So let us say we now have, from the old list and new additions, a combined canon of twenty texts for these ten years. This is already at the limit for most specialists, and it still leaves out more than 200 novels—everything less definable, appealing, or polemically useful. Someone may eventually produce a detailed study of these texts, the sort of thing that Jerry Beasley did for the 1740s, John Richetti for the early eighteenth century, and J. M. S.

            <Text>My work to contextualize Radcliffe among hundreds of noncanonical novels is in keeping with the voracious habits of her readers. Although Radcliffe was, by the time she published The Mysteries of Udolpho, widely recognized as a master of her craft, she was not canonized separately from other Gothic writers either on the shelves of he circulating libraries or in the minds of book reviewers. [As Michael Gamer compellingly argues, later Romantic writers needed to present their Gothic works as being of a different kind than the “low” supernatural / superstitious [stuff], but Radcliffe predates that: She was producing better Gothics, not non-Gothics] Her readers’ voraciousness is particularly important to our understanding of her works in light of Frow’s articulation of genre as, not a stable set of categories, but an ongoing conversation. Individual texts, Frow argues, “do not ‘belong’ to genres, but are, rather, uses of them”. Genre is not a stable identifier, but a set of expectations which an author may strategically fulfill or foil.

            <Title>some horror motifs</Title>
            <Text>The “horror” tag, certainly, is associated with a number of motifs. Predictably, too, the “horror” motifs look similar to the men’s motifs. At the top of the list of “horror” motifs is “Inquisition” — 63% of “horror” Gothics include the Inquisition, an enormous increase over the baseline 15% presence of that motif. This striking result lends credence to the work of scholars like Robert Miles who take conspiracy as a central horror-Gothic concern. Next, less expectedly, are secret doors, at the exact same level of increase — 48% more secret doors in “horror” novels than in the corpus as a whole. “Horror” Gothics also have 47% more prophetic dreams, 46% more corpses, 40% more drugging, and 39% more banishment than the corpus as a whole. These motifs remain distinctly associated with “horror” when we instead compare “horror” directly to “terror,” rather than comparing the corpus as a whole: all of these occur two to three times more often with the “horror” tag than with “terror”. Horror and terror are most sharply distinguished from each other, though, by “actual incest”, which occurs five times more often with “horror” than with “terror”. As when Tracy was considered alone, this minor motif has strong predictive power. The next strongest distinguishing motifs are “Satan and lesser demons” and “loose woman”, both of which appear four times more frequently in “horror” than in “terror”. Three times more frequent in “horror” works are “rape”, “pre-nuptial death”, and “banishment.” All of these motifs paint a distinct horror tradition, which our earlier models also allow us to see as male. But they also complicate our understanding of “horror” by introducing motifs which were previously not male-dominated enough to become part of the categorical definition.</Text>
            <Comments>Interestingly, this represents 3 “horror” tagged works and 2 “terror” tagged works. One of those “terror” works is Matthew Lewis’s The Monk, which is tagged as both “horror” and “terror”, but the other is Ancient Records, Or, The Abbey Of Saint Oswythe, by T. J. Horsley Curties, which is only tagged “terror”. Two other works containing “incest, actual” are not tagged as either “horror” nor “terror”. Having reached clusters of only two or three texts, however, these samples are too small to bear sustained statistical scrutiny.</Comments>

            <Title>histories of the novel</Title>
            <Text>Histories of the eighteenth-century British novel have nearly always sought to explain how and why the novel transformed itself over the course of the century, and, as a result, these histories nearly always end up offering a teleological and selective account. This collection employs several strategies to avoid such a problem
/
Despite the numbers of novelists to which it directs new attention, this history often tacitly perpetuates existing hierarchies of value, rather than defining these or challenging them on the behalf of the works it reclaims. 
While it is possible that a subsequent history of the novel might differentiate itself from this one by taking an explicitly aesthetic turn, it is also possible that the approaches pursued so rewardingly in this volume might be taken further with digital technologies.
Clifford Siskin argues for seeing the history of the novel in the eighteenth century as a complex process of emergence rather than a triumphal rise. 
 Suggesting “emergence” as a more useful term than “rise” to describe the genre’s history, especially in the context of scholarship that highlights new data and a multitude of texts, Siskin brings in the idea of “novelism” from his earlier work to argue that it was this novelism— discourse of and about the novel—that ultimately generated the idea of Literature.
In this book, the history of the novel looks rather like a Pieter Bruegel the Elder painting, packed with individuals, some in the foreground and some in the background, but all presented with great detail and all, in their di erent actions, contributing to the overall e ect of the image. And it is full of life and activity.  This feels right: the history of the novel is not a uni ed narrative, but precisely the kind of diversi ed picture presented in OHNE.

“Major Authors and Traditions” section gathers fourteen essays, with ten focusing on subgenres.  The remaining four essays are devoted to the authors that the editors consider major in this period: Smollett, Laurence Sterne, Jane Austen, and Scott. 

Godwin’s Things As They Are (1794), according to its Critical reviewer, ranked ‘greatly above the whole mass of publications which bear the name of novels’, excepting perhaps ‘the productions of Fielding, Smollet [sic], and Burney’.13 The inclusion here of Burney matches a tendency at this stage for more general observers to link different generations of novelists with some degree of equality

A parallel realignment of the canon is also perceptible in novels such as Robert Bisset’s reactionary Douglas; or, The Highlander (1800), with Fielding granted precedence over Richardson, Burney being separated off from Radcliffe and Smith, and Godwin and his circle excoriated out of existence in the most violent of personal attacks.

Scott skims a thin layer of ‘insipid’ sentimental fictions, before biting on the new scurrility: ‘we have now the lowest denizens of Grub-street narrating, under the flimsy veil of false names, and through the medium of a fictitious tale, all that malevolence can invent (p. 403) and stupidity propagate’. Delving further, he confronts a number of formulaic imitations of Radcliffe and Lewis, amidst which the Fatal Revenge stands out as the product of a gifted, if misdirected, writer.
The introductory sequence, mockingly speculating possible subtitles, parallels the Maturin review in proceeding through the Radcliffeian Gothic (‘a castle scarce less than that of Udolpho, of which the eastern wing has been long uninhabited’), a more Lewisian ‘Romance from the German’, a ‘Sentimental Tale’ (‘sufficient presage of a heroine with a profusion of auburn hair, and a harp’), and a ‘A Tale of the Times’ ( ‘a dashing sketch of the fashionable world, a few anecdotes of private scandal thinly veiled’).18 Eschewing such possibilities, Scott then settles on a tale of men and manners, set just within living memory, adopting at first a narrative tone strongly reminiscent of Fielding

How much rewriting of the novel’s literary history lies ahead is suggested by a comparison of James Raven’s table of the sixty-seven novels published from 1770 to 1799 that went to five editions or more by 1829 with Gary Kelly’s English Fiction of the Romantic Period, 1789–1830 (London: Longman, 1989). Thirty-nine of those very popular novels first appeared in the overlapping years from 1789 to 1799, but Kelly mentions only twenty of them.
Novels accounted for at most 8 percent of all books published and were a niche business dominated by publishers like William Lane of Minerva Press fame and Henry Colburn of silver-fork-novel renown.
Lane's rise to pre-eminence coincides with a large upsurge in titles in the late 1780s, and the Minerva's dominance in this respect continued almost unabated until the 1820s. In all but three years (1807, 1808, and 1818) Lane and/or Newman were responsible for at least 25% of new titles — and on two occasions, in 1795 and 1801, Lane actually claimed more than half of the annual total. Colburn's contribution begins with a trickle in 1806, and develops only slightly in numerical terms until the floodgates open after the financial crisis of 1825/26. From then to the end of the decade Colburn effectively replaced the Minerva by publishing at least 25% of new titles, culminating with exactly half (thirty-four out of sixty-eight) in 1829. Other publishers — for example, Hookham in the last two decades of the eighteenth century, or Longmans early in the nineteenth —took a clear stake in fiction, but only one can be said to have dominated in a way comparable to Lane and Colburn. From 1807-08 J. F. Hughes of Wigmore Street, Cavendish Square, claimed his own quarter share of titles, outstripping in both years the Minerva Press, which was experiencing something of an ebb in its fortunes during the transfer of control from Lane to Newman.
In Hughes's output it is possible to trace an accelerating movement, sometimes involving the same authors, from sentimental and Radcliffian pot-boilers, though anglicized schauerroman and Monk-like horror, to 'fashionable' anecdote and scandal. At the same time, it is important to bear in mind that Gothic and sentimental novels continued as mainstays of his production to the end. Of sixty-four titles examined at first hand, the majority fall in almost equal proportions into the broad categories of sentimental, Gothic, and scandal fiction. The list is completed by a smattering of 'historical' novels (though the distinction between these and the Gothic and/or sentimental is sometimes blurred), and two late pseudo-Irish works.

            <Text>‘Male’ and ‘Female’ Novels? Gendered Fictions and the Reading Public, 1770–1832
The fiction from 1770 to 1830 shows the strains of a society that increasingly identified cultural consumption with gender. Whereas the sentimental novels of the 1770s used epistolary narrators to relate stories of love and feeling from the perspective of both men and women, by the 1790s the new, Gothic novels were centred on women besieged by tyranny from without and uncertainty from within. This genre fiction contributed to the derogation of the novel and its association with an undiscriminating female audience. Throughout the period, women were held up as the quintessential novel-readers because more women were visibly writing and reading novels than ever before, and because the popular marriage plot, female hero, thematic focus on etiquette, and emphasis on delicacy and refinement all seemed to speak to feminine concerns. In fact, most novel- writers and novel-readers were men because men wrote and read more than women. 

Austen’s joke is that Thorpe—and by extension men in general—actually do read novels, and not only those with roguish male heroes, like Fielding’s Tom Jones (1749), or lurid scenes of rape and corruption, exemplified by Lewis’s The Monk (1796). As Thorpe confesses, men even read Gothic mysteries centred on persecuted women, like Radcliffe’s The Mysteries of Udolpho (1796). His attitude sketches out the battle-lines in the gendering of literary culture: whereas women read fantasy, ‘stuff and nonsense’, so ran the common claim, men read ‘fun and nature’, tales about violence, adventure, and real life. 
In fact, John Thorpe and Catherine admire precisely the same books: Gothic romances set in the dark past, depicting sensitive heroines mystified by traces of bloodshed and ghostly noises, and besieged by tyrannical murderers in remote castles. These novels exemplified cheap fiction for the audience at the turn of the nineteenth century and were publicly identified as women’s novels because of their feminine heroines and plots, and because of the places and ways they were read. However, Gothic novels were only one subgenre of fiction during the period from 1770 to 1820. They came to exemplify flawed, female fiction because they grew to be highly popular in the years following the French Revolution in 1789, when England was reeling with horror at the French violations of law, social convention, and gender roles. England’s defensiveness, indeed panic, during the period centred on who read, how and why they read, and especially what they read, and women seemed to be not only the targeted audience, but feminine ways of using the novel seemed to exemplify social decay. This prejudice was mainly based on fictions about fiction, and reflects not the reality of the reading public but a gendered discourse that centred on the novel. Fiction became the flashpoint for these gender anxieties because the novel was the central, prominent signal and symptom of a changing society, because the new kinds of novels focused on sexualized sensibility, and because of the rising female cultural presence. 
Sentimental and Epistolary Novels 
during the 1770s with the surge of sentimentalism, novels broached new ground. These novels made emotion central to character and plot by deploying the new sentimental philosophy that held that human instincts were naturally benevolent, and that sympathy for fellow creatures demonstrated moral virtue. Such novels came by the end of the eighteenth century to be identified as ‘female’ partly because they followed the format set by the most influential innovator of epistolary fiction: Samuel Richardson. 
Laurence Sterne composes his immensely popular, nine-volume sentimental fiction The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy (1759–68) as the first-person narrative of his troubled protagonist, Tristram, writing to intimate readers conjured in his mind.  … Sterne, however, did provide the model for Henry Mackenzie’s The Man of Feeling (1771), in which an unidentified narrator records for his own benefit his observations of Harley, the titular sentimental hero—a youth whose sensibilities are so acute that he expires of a suppressed love that he is too shy to declare and that hence mutates into physical disease, and although the protagonist is a man, the novel became a byword for the sort of sexually titillating fiction that women, especially young women, purportedly adored. 
By the 1770s, indeed, many male protagonists were manifesting sentimental delicacy.
By the late 1770s, sentimental novels also increasingly featured women heroines and themes of female feeling. This translated in fiction into characters whose emotional responses to any acts of kindness or cruelty or violence and to scenes of beauty testified to their heroism. 
if men and women both wrote sentimentally, the treatment of sex itself still became a main dividing line between genres and between audiences. The more explicit the treatment, the less women were involved—as authors or, presumably, audiences.
Gothic and Conduct Novels 
Sentimental and epistolary fiction may have drawn readers’ tears, but the subgenre that followed them, the Gothic novel, won different responses. Gothic novels solicited gasps of fear and shock—not merely reactions to the horrible events portrayed in the novel, but outraged responses to the horrible techniques of novels themselves. Gothic novels, with their exaggeratedly villainous and virtuous characters, improbable and tangled plots, themes of violence and violation, and sensationalistic techniques, obviously defied the realistic conventions governing earlier fiction. Critics’ disparagements, however, also resulted from the added weight novels bore as vehicles of emotional training for young readers. This emphasis on the instructiveness of fiction, itself a dramatic shift in literary aesthetics and philosophy, was largely caused by contemporary events. Novels in the 1790s were perched uneasily at the crux of a storm of ideas about politics, education, gender roles, and social practices as England, following the French Revolution, experienced a fierce, moralistic backlash that segregated and solidified gender roles. 
Yet the arguments that, first, only women read novels at all, and yet, secondly, that only bad women read novels whereas good women read good works—particularly sermons and conduct manuals—were manifestly untrue. By defining her novel as a ‘Moral Tale’, Edgeworth herself collapses the distinction between fictional tale-telling and morality, and reflects the fact that, since so many women read novels, neither all the women nor all the novels could be bad. Moreover, new novels had been a central topic of fashionable conversation for half a century, and novel-reading women were becoming increasingly visible as cultural consumers. Gender nonetheless remained a vital element in the construction, reception, and analysis of the form, and the issues it raises illuminate the development of the genre. 
‘By a Lady’: The Gender of Authors and 
Aesthetics 
What genders a novel? Is a ‘female’ novel so defined because it is written ‘By a Lady’, for ladies, or about ladies? Daniel Defoe’s Moll Flanders (1722), albeit written by a man, is certainly presented by a female narrator, and it is about a woman, but its tale of promiscuity and theft appealed as much to men as women. So did his cautionary tale purportedly for women, Roxana (1724), which chronicled its protagonist’s descent into whoredom, murder, and madness. By the late eighteenth century, however, more women than ever before were writing novels, and recent research has shown that they produced about a third of those published.9 From 1770 to 1800, novels identified as female on their title pages crested, but so, indeed, did all novels, rising to 100 new (p. 362) fictions a year in 1800.10 Still, the prominence of the attribution ‘By a Lady’ indicates a shift in the relationship of gender to literature, particularly fiction: it signals that gender was becoming an aesthetic or formal aspect of fiction-writing—a matter not of the author’s sex but of the book’s.11 Books that centred on women’s lives were not necessarily woman-authored, but they were perceived as probably so: on reading Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, Annabella Milbanke (who became Lady Byron) speculated that it might have been written by Charlotte Smith, author of the popular Emmeline (1789), commenting to her mother: ‘I wish much to know who is the author or ess I am told.’12 
Fiction ‘By a Lady’ constituted only a part of the novels on offer in part because many authors of both genders remained anonymous, at least in their first efforts: of the 1,421 novels published between 1770 and 1799, the vast majority lacked any authorial attribution—no less than 71.3 per cent 
Women also were understood to have a different sensibility from men. More protected and delicately built, they were attributed with trembling sensibilities centred on domesticity and romance. With greater private time and fewer distractions than men, women were also thought to brood upon the nuances of emotion and behaviour. Whereas early sentimental novelists saw this as a virtue, later writers found it dangerous because it could cause either self-destructive despair, or sexual excess. 
Their confined experience also appeared to allow women unique access to psychological depth. This psychological approach particularly flourished in the subgenre of the female Gothic, which emphasized the uncertainties of perception that heroines suffer in an obscure, dangerous, patriarchal world. Ann Radcliffe’s Gothic novels exemplify the genre by portraying heroines fleeing male violence or confined by tyrants, and entangled in murky plots featuring nefarious outlaws, madness, and murder. The suspense arises less from the dramatic action than from the technique of representing the scenes entirely through the protagonist’s consciousness. 
Radcliffe’s plot unravels through the fears, confusions, and superstitions of her heroine, so that readers can never clearly see where the truth lies. 
(p. 365) However, the very narrowness of women’s experience was also credited with giving them an insight into social dynamics that translated into social realism 
I Never Read Novels’: The Gender of 
Readers and Reading 
Among the fictions about fiction that stoked the fires of moral panic in the early Romantic period was the visibility of women reading novels. In fact, most novel-readers were male, as most readers always had been. By the mid-eighteenth century, only about 60 per cent of men and 40 per cent of women could read at all, and, while works of religion, history, geography, and travel outstripped novels in most libraries, provincial novel-readers and library-borrowers were primarily male.24 In fact, men and women read largely the same books: the Prince Regent and his court admired Jane Austen’s novels, for example; she herself read purportedly immoral fictions by Fielding and Sterne, whom she parodies in her juvenilia; and Tristram himself reveals that he expects women to read his narrative by adjuring his reader on one famous occasion as ‘Madam!’. The poet and fiction reviewer Anna Laetitia Barbauld, wife of a minister, even commended the delicacy of Sterne’s sentimental touches.25 
The proliferation of circulating fiction was seen to parallel the proliferation of female readers, and, indeed, publishers like the Minerva Press deliberately targeted women as their audience. The change in the sexual and social composition of the audience was a cultural shock. Women readers in great numbers, especially middle-class women, were a new audience, and as such, like servants, shook the status quo by which literacy had demarcated the elite. By reading, women penetrated the public sphere as they never had before. 
Much of the anxiety concerning women reading resulted from where they read: places that seemed sequestered, improper, private, and fed a solitariness and secrecy that seemed to breed illegitimate fantasies.
While the model of moral reading remained devotional—the medieval study of a few texts, the daily conning of the Bible, the memorization and contemplation of selected, venerable works—the rush to read the newest novel required readers to speed through hundreds of pages. They seemed to read for the plot rather than the moral, for the sentimental vignette rather than the intellectual conception, for the quick fix of feeling instead of the lesson for life. There were so many books that they thus seemed to demand extensive rather than intensive reading 
Moreover, while men clearly also identified with heroes (and, indeed, heroines), they were trained in scepticism, judgement, and restraint whereas it was thought that women read corporeally, and thus experienced the physical effects of sympathy like blushing and fainting. Fiction thus seemed to feed their anti-intellectual instincts. The novel appeared to embody a new and gendered way of consuming literary culture itself. 
Conclusion: The Gender of Novels 

Novels from 1770 to 1830 change style, theme, and mode. In the 1770s, sentimental epistolary fiction dominates; the 1780s see the beginning of conduct novels that last well into the Victorian period; the 1790s witness a thunderclap of Gothic; and by the 1810s, Romantic fiction was becoming the latest subgenre. Yet to readers from 1770 to 1830, individual novels also appear to have, or at least to hint at, a gender themselves. This identification of a text with a sex was manufactured from the combination of the gender of their heroes, their plots and settings, their aesthetic techniques, and a moral tone that solicited either male or female readers. 
As many women novelists at the beginning of the nineteenth century transformed conduct literature into a fictional form, proving lessons in social etiquette and self-discipline woven into love stories, Romantic fiction, spurred on by Scott, made extreme characters and epic scope the novel’s province. ‘Interesting’ stories—that is, stories with a love interest—and stories of familial relations, female roles, and women’s behaviour were considered ‘female’.32 Conduct fiction that placed the sentimental heroine not in situations of deadly danger in faraway lands, but plumb in the middle of upper-echelon English society similarly seemed instructions for women alone, whereas Romantic fiction that placed her—or more often, him—on the margins challenged social conventions in a fashion that undermined social mores. Thus, according to (p. 369) Reeve, didactic texts which advance virtue and morality were coded as ‘female’, whereas texts like Fielding’s or Scott’s with roistering heroes, adventurous plots, and promiscuous heroes, previously considered fare for both genders, were considered male.  
The supposed division between a male and a female book is particularly clear in the contrast between Jane Austen’s Mansfield Park and Scott’s Waverley; or ’Tis Sixty Years Since, both published in 1814. In both novels, the heroes are distracted by inappropriate suitors but find true love, and in both a quarrel in the family—between brothers, in Scott’s case, and sisters in Austen’s— stimulate the complications of the plot. In the man’s novel, however, the male hero leaves home and, despite misadventures, regains his honour and wins a pardon through military action; in the woman’s, the heroine earns status and reward by moral self-discipline and passive resistance. 
Nonetheless, ‘male’ and ‘female’ novels of the period share themes and plot lines. Foremost are the themes of the discovery of identity and recovery of inheritance. In Smollett’s Humphry Clinker, the servant Humphry is discovered miraculously to be the natural son of his irascible but tender-hearted master, Matthew Bramble, while, among many other examples, Radcliffe’s Romance of the Forest (1791), The Mysteries of Udolpho, and The Italian (1797), not to mention Eleanor Sleath’s Minerva Press novel Orphan of the Rhine (1798), all concern the heroine’s recovery of her identity and fortune. By the nineteenth century, in fact, reading and readers of novels began to escape gender- identification as the genre became a respected part of British literary heritage, legitimate —even laudable—reading-matter for both genders. Significantly, Barbauld’s British Novelists, itself an emblem of the rise of the novel’s prestige in the Romantic period, does not differentiate authors by gender or novels by subgenre: Elizabeth Inchbald, Charlotte Smith, Frances Burney, and Ann Radcliffe conclude the series, but her list includes French and German titles, satirical and historical fictions, even a Chinese novel, as well as the by-then canonical productions of Laurence Sterne, Henry Fielding, Samuel Richardson, Samuel Johnson, and a host of works now forgotten. In fact, Barbauld uses the new prominence of women writers to prove the genre’s probity, declaring that: ‘A very great proportion of [good writers] are ladies: and surely it will not be said that either taste or moral have been losers by their taking the pen.’35 By the end of the Regency, as Romanticism began gradually to shift into what would become a Victorian moral aesthetic, it was still Scott’s Waverley that grew so madly popular with both genders that it sold out its 1,000 copies in five weeks, and appeared in six editions by the end of the year.36 The novel had become a genderless literary genre.

            <Text>Although I will use a number of graphs to make my argument, the key term for my methodological approach is not “data visualization,” but “modelling.” Johanna Drucker has given compelling warnings about the dangers of treating constructed information as empirically objective “data” which may then be passively “visualized”. Willard McCarty’s discussion of models as both “pragmatic” and “fictive” is more accurate to the scholarly process of gathering, classifying, correlating, and interpreting information. Whether a model is a reading or a bar chart, the worth of that model must be judged by its “fruitfulness”, a term for which Stephen Ramsay provides a useful definition:  “the robustness of the discussion that a particular procedure annunciates”. In other words, whether or not the model has revealed what we expected to see, it has revealed something with which we must now engage. Exact corerspondence is thus less of a “fundamental principle”, and more of an imagined destination which spurs valuable journeys. This flexibility allows us to cope with the fact that as a model is constructed, it becomes sensitive to some areas of difference while eliding others. No model needs to be accurate in all points, so long as it is sensitive to the desired area of differences. It is also worth noting that not all models are computational, as is evidenced by the meticulous historical research of Leah Price, whose monograph The Anthology and the Rise of the Novel argues that any edited text — ‘elaborate’ or not — produces, not a flawed or distorted copy of the original, but a new text. As Price observes, when scholars examine texts — when we take notes on them, extract quotes for close reading, summarize of categorize scenes, chapters of books — our act of reading is also one of editing. McCarty allows us to recognize that this mental editing is not a sign of scholarly weakness, but a model, made necessary by the limits of human memory.</Text>

            <Text>The English Novel, 1770–1829: A Bibliographical Survey of Prose Fic- tion Published in the British Isles. General editors, Peter Garside, James Raven, and Rainer Schöwerling. Volume 1: 1770–1799. Edited by James Raven and Antonia Forster, with the assistance of Stephen Bending. Vol- ume 2: 1800–1829. Edited by Peter Garside and Rainer Schöwerling, with the assistance of Christopher Skelton-Foord and Karin Wünsche. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2000. Pp. xix+864; xiv+753. 
The entries are richly detailed. In addition to author, title, and pub- lishing information, they give a novel’s number of volumes, pagina- tion, format, and price; and they provide references to contemporary reviews, to the libraries holding copies, and to any short-title catalog number. The copy examined by the bibliographers is specified along with its shelf-list number. The list of libraries is valuable for future his- torians, since most titles have few extant first-edition copies. The notes include information about dedicatees, issue variations, subscription lists, included advertisements, subsequent editions, translations, and attributions. The first volume has fuller notes, with extracts of reviews from the Monthly Review and the Critical Review. 
As one would expect, titles with no known first-edition copy occur more frequently in the first volume. Nevertheless, fully 90 percent of its 1,421 titles have survived, while in the second volume over 98 percent of its 2,256 titles have. 
Moreover, of the hundred titles in the second volume that are known to survive only in a copy from the remarkable Schloss Corvey Library, a mere five were not listed in the English Catalogue of Books or not noticed in the reviews. This suggests the bibliographers have drawn their net very tightly in applying their finding methods to the short-title catalogs and that only a handful of novel titles are likely to have eluded them. 
p.624: Almost all of these novels have long since been deservedly forgotten. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.624: How much rewriting of the novel’s literary history lies ahead is suggested by a comparison of James Raven’s table of the sixty-seven novels published from 1770 to 1799 that went to five editions or more by 1829 with Gary Kelly’s English Fiction of the Romantic Period, 1789–1830 (London: Longman, 1989). Thirty-nine of those very popular novels first appeared in the overlapping years from 1789 to 1799, but Kelly mentions only twenty of them. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

p.625: Only novels that had two or more editions were likely to have been purchased by individuals. And only those authors who had an established reputation were published in first editions larger than five hundred copies. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
Raven presents the numbers from the tables oddly as a five-year moving average to create a smoother curve, a method that does not make sense for these novels because they are reliably dated (often through the editors’ efforts) and because their postdating is generally limited to a few months.

“As digital humanists have adopted visualization tools in their work, they have borrowed methods developed for the graphical display of information in the natural and social sciences. These tools carry with them assumptions of knowledge as observer-independent and certain, rather than observer codependent and interpretative.”
“But, I will argue, such graphical tools are a kind of intellectual Trojan horse, a vehicle through which assumptions about what constitutes information swarm with potent force. These assumptions are cloaked in a rhetoric taken wholesale from the techniques of the empirical sciences that conceals their epistemological biases under a guise of familiarity.”
“Rendering observation (the act of creating a statistical, empirical, or subjective account or image) as if it were the same as the phenomena observed collapses the critical distance between the phenomenal world and its interpretation”
“This requires first and foremost that we reconceive all data as capta. Differences in the etymological roots of the terms data and capta make the distinction between constructivist and realist approaches clear. Capta is "taken" actively while data is assumed to be a "given" able to be recorded and observed.”
“the sheer power of the graphical display of "information visualization" (and its novelty within a humanities community newly enthralled with the toys of data mining and display) seems to have produced a momentary blindness among practitioners who would never tolerate such literal assumptions in textual work.”
“Charts use simple (if often misleading) geometric forms that lend themselves to legible comparison of values, proportions, or the exhibition of state changes across time.”
“They render quantitative relations with a transparency that seems natural”
“the rendering of statistical information into graphical form gives it a simplicity and legibility that hides every aspect of the original interpretative framework”
“The graphical force conceals what the statistician knows very well — that no "data" preexist their parameterization”
“a humanistic approach to the qualitative display of graphical information”
“the basic categories of supposedly quantitative information, the fundamental parameters of chart production, are already interpreted expressions. But they do not present themselves as categories of interpretation, riven with ambiguity and uncertainty, because of the representational force of the visualization as a "picture" of "data".”
“The ordering and arrangement of elements within a chart create another level of information, relational information. Relational information is graphically produced – the ordering of elements by size, by color, by alphabetical order, by texture, shape or other feature happens in graphical space. The resulting arrangement has a semantic value produced by features of proximity, grouping, orientation, apparent movement, and other graphical effects.”
“For instance, what is a novel, what does "published" mean in this context (date of appearance, editing, composition, acquisition, review, distribution), and how was the "year" determined. Statistical methods come into play after these decisions have been made, counting objects whose identity was established by interpretative decisions.”
“the subjective display of humanistic phenomena can be applied across the domains with which we are concerned at at least four basic levels of interpretation or knowledge production.1. Modelling phenomenological experience in the making of humanities (data as capta, primary modeling, the representation of temporal and spatial experience);2. Modeling relations among humanities documents i.e. discourse fields (a different metric is needed to understand dates on diplomatic documents in the spring of 1944 than one needed to constitute understanding of those dated to the same period of the spring of 1950 etc.);3. Modeling the representations of temporality and spatiality that are in humanities documents (narrative is the most obvious);4. Modeling the interpretation of any of the above (depicting or graphing the performative quality of interpretation).”
“In some circumstances (the example of the bar chart given earlier that was displaying information about gender, nations, and populations) ambiguity merely requires a higher order level of complexity in the model, so that apparent "certainties" are qualified by variables and nuances that can be specified in mathematical terms. But the idea of capta as fundamentally codependent, constituted relationally, between observer and observed phenomena, is fundamentally different from the concept of data created as an observerindependent phenomena.”


The consumability of eye-candy-like, data-driven visualizations that appear in public art, private galleries, and published compendia is evidence of their seductive success as ideological instruments. Halpern wants us to reflect upon the implications of such aesthetic legitimation and ways we might resist the force of data displays that are integrated into the management infrastructure of technologized culture.

            <Text>[Many scholars have been directing new attention toward the sentimental, none of which I knew anything about at the time of these experiments; I was surprised and confused by my findings, and thus offer them, paltry as they are, as an invigorating independent confirmation of e.g. Alex Wetmore]

The picture which Frank’s model paints, of a women’s Gothic equally as tied to the sentimental novel as to the high Gothic, [points toward a new understanding of the Gothic’s geneaology generally.] [This new sentimental geneaology makes some things about the Gothic more clear.] [A full acknowledgement of the Gothic’s sentimental ties can explain, for example, the comparison of Udolpho to Elizabeth Inchbald’s A Simple Story which so puzzles Clara McIntyre in Ann Radcliffe in Relation To Her Time.] In response to a review which declared Udolpho to be “the best composition of this kind since Mrs. Inchbald’s Simple Story,” McIntyre is taken aback by the expression “of this kind”. She says, “The reviewer must surey be thinking of fiction in general, for, except that they are both fiction, two compositions could hardly be more unlike than The Mysteries of Udolpho and A Simple Story.” McIntyre draws a tentative connection based on “the ethical purpose of the book,” which in Inchbald is “rather too obvious for successful art,” but decides that although Radcliffe’s writing, “it is true, was strictly moral,” Radcliffe’s “main interest” does not lie in moralizing. McIntyre has thus identified what I argue is the key connection between the two works, but overlooks its significance: moral sentiment, and its connection to the emotional experience of the reader, is the throughline which connects the Gothic deeply to its non-Gothic literary context, and to the broader intellectual debates at the end of the Englightenment.</Text>
            <Comments>HBBO: “It seems to me that you may, slightly, be trying to have things both ways here: if the sentimental thread within the Gothic tradition is heavily gendered (as Frank leads us to believe), then is it valid to draw conclusions about the general genealogy of the Gothic from the more specific subgenre of the women's sentimental Gothic? This I think you can resolve to some extent by lampshading the issue: even if only a subset of early Gothic authors counted sentimental novels as a primary influence, all your points about perceived similarities between works (which now seem bizarre) and the potential of adapting critical apparatus of sentimental literature to gothic lit, remain valid. But I do think you should address it, especially since you slice &amp; dice these data sets so many different ways, and readers may have trouble tracking on what ends up looking surprisingly ungendered/mainstream (e.g. "terror") and where strongly gendered links have been established (e.g. "sentimental”).”

            <Text>Critical Frameworks 
In determining my approach, I draw upon McCarty’s framework of the strengths and limits of “modeling,” with influence from Samuels and McGann’s discussion of “deformance,” to allow for models which are sensitive to certain distinctions but not to others. McCarty, in proposing language to discuss literary models and their epistemological implications, elaborates upon a distinction made by Clifford Geertz between models “of” something and models “for” something (McCarty). Blueprints of historical buildings, for example, allow inquiry into the details of something that already exists, whereas blueprints for new buildings allow architectural 

1 After much experimentation, I have opted not to pursue analysis of the words of any actual texts, whether literary or bibliographic. Certainly, the early Gothic is uncharted territory for computational stylometry; the one corpus-based analysis which I was able to discover, an MSc dissertation by Stephanie Jones (2010), begins its investigation in 1816, well past the Gothic’s first flourishing. However, full-text analysis relies on having full texts, which are readily available only for the most critically-examined novels. It is the nature of my project to rely on the work of my scholarly predecessors, but I did not wish to replicate this emphasis of attention.

ideas to be explored before they are brought into reality; both ways of modeling “comprise a practical means of playing out the consequences of an idea in the real world” (McCarty), from two different directions. My several attempts to model the Gothic novel, as a genre experienced by its popular readership in the late eighteenth century, are certainly models of that genre. As such, their merit at first seems most appropriately evaluated in terms of their compliance with the “fundamental principle” of modeling-of, namely, the “exact correspondence between model and object with respect to the webs of relationships among the selected elements in each” (McCarty). By this principle, my essay ought to focus on those preliminary models which retained the most detail about the texts in question: Tracy’s plot summaries, for example, or even a much-smaller corpus containing full texts of famous Gothics. However, as McCarty ultimately concludes, “modeling is pragmatic” (McCarty); immediately after defining the “fundamental principle” of “exact correspondence,” McCarty describes two reasons it may be violated: when exact correspondence is impossible for practical reasons, and when it has been intentionally distorted in order to study the effects of those distortions. 
Exact correspondence is, of course, never a practical option; if there have been no adjustments of scale or materials, the object of study is no longer a model at all, but the thing itself. Tautologically, models are only needed when the thing itself is in some way unsuitable for study— too big, too complicated, or no longer in complete existence— and so models are always ultimately “fictional” (McCarty). Because these fictions have been created with particular goals in mind—because, McCarty says, “modeling is pragmatic”—he argues that “the worth of a model must be judged by its fruitfulness” (McCarty). Stephen Ramsay’s “Algorithmic Criticism” provides a metric for evaluating that fruitfulness: “the robustness of the discussion that a particular procedure annunciates” (Ramsay). This seems to be what McCarty implicitly means 
Lawrence Evalyn 4 
when he terms something “fruitful”: whether or not the model has revealed what we expected, it has revealed something with which we must now engage. Exact correspondence is thus less of a “fundamental principle” (McCarty), and more of an imagined destination that spurs valuable journeys. As a model is constructed, it becomes sensitive to some areas of difference while eliding others. Models need not be perfectly accurate, only sensitive to the desired area of difference. 
McCarty also describes models which are not merely partial in some particular set of details, but which “deliberately” diverge from their source “in order to study the consequences” of the changes. McCarty terms these intentional manipulations “distortion,” but Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann might call them “deformance.” I take this term from their essay “Deformance and Interpretation,” which seeks to untangle the mechanics of interpretation as a critical act, and the ways in which interpretation distorts artistic works in service of its own performative operations.2 Whether the final interpreted meaning is “resident ‘in’ the work, or evoked through ‘reader-response,’ or deconstructable” — whichever framework is used for the method of “reading along thematic lines” — the method itself, they argue, is neither transparent nor the only option (26). Although “criticism... tends to imagine itself as an informative rather than a deformative activity,” both scholarly editions and translations of texts take critical interpretations and write them onto the texts themselves (33). Similarly, “heretical and... 

2 For a recognition of the methodologies of “ordinary ‘paper based’ literary criticism” (Ramsay), I could also have taken Stephen Ramsay’s “Algorithmic Criticism” as my foundation. Ramsay argues that “[a]ny reading of a text... relies on a heuristic of radical transformation” (Ramsay), noting that “[t]he critic who endeavors to put forth a ‘reading,’ puts forth not the text, but a new text in which the data has been paraphrased, elaborated, selected, truncated, and transduced” (Ramsay). However, Ramsay ultimately subordinates his computational experiments to “the grander rhetorical formations that constitute critical reading” (Ramsay). I take Samuels and McGann as my starting-place largely for their willingness to treat their created texts seriously as new and separate objects of interpretation.

nonnormative readings of established cultural artifacts” (35), typically undertaken in service of a particular point, constitute deformation. Placing themselves in this tradition, Samuels and McGann apply several deformative interpretive approaches to the poetry of Wallace Stevens. Each deformation is a procedure for rewriting a poem — reordering its lines from last to first, or deleting all the words but the nouns or the verbs — which spurs a new interpretation of the new version of the text. The key advantage of these deformations is a fruitful defamiliarization of the object of study: the procedure “reinstalls the text — any text, prose or verse — as a performative event, a made thing” (30) by rendering the mechanics of its creation salient. When readers cannot ignore the critic’s act of re-writing, we are implicitly asked to engage again with the author’s earlier act of writing. This defamiliarization allows us to “imagine things about the text that we did not and perhaps could not otherwise know” (36), because we have been re-sensitized to new details of the work. 
It is through this new sensitivity that Samuels and McGann begin to echo McCarty. The two essays at first seem to be concerned with very different approaches, but they converge by way of Leah Price. In The Anthology and the Rise of the Novel, Price draws attention to the ways in which all reading, and particularly all scholarly writing, must involve a constant re-editing of texts, influenced by memory and argument. In keeping with Samuels and McGann’s classification of “[e]laborate scholarly editions” (33) as deformative criticism, Price argues that any edited text — ‘elaborate’ or not — produces, not a flawed or distorted copy of the original, but a new text. The process of editing a text must always reveal the editor’s “unspoken assumptions about the most efficient way to convey information, and indeed what counts as information at all” (13), and thus gives us a new thing to examine. As Price observes, when scholars examine texts— when we take notes on them, extract quotes for close reading, 
Lawrence Evalyn 6 
summarize or categorize scenes, chapters, or books— our act of reading is also one of editing. McCarty allows us to recognize that this mental editing is not a sign of scholarly weakness, but a model, made necessary by the limits of human memory. Price’s project is more interested in the literal anthologizing undertaken by publishers than in the mental anthologizing implicit in the scholarly act of thinking about several books at once; her ultimate argument is about the works of George Eliot, not about the methodology of literary criticism. Nonetheless, her observations, once anthologized in abridged form alongside digital humanities thinkers, allows us to ‘bare the devices’ of literary criticism itself. 
My own modeling framework is informed by all of these. My key ideas are sensitivity in data selection, and procedurality in visual representation. My two ‘texts’ – Tracy’s and Frank’s bibliographies – are themselves two very different deformative models of ‘The Gothic Novel,’ and each render different distinctions more or less salient. When forming my research questions, I begin by asking what a given source of information allows me to be sensitive to. Tracy’s motifs emphasize events and singular images, with each detail systematically tallied. In contrast, Frank’s Gothic types emphasize a work’s overall tone, and his evaluations are at times maddeningly qualitative and subtle. The two are thus able to usefully complement each other. As I work with these texts, I dwell upon procedure as a way to meditate upon the implications of earlier critics’ frameworks. Because I must iterate all of my decisions at least 178 times when I decide to include a new axis of distinction in my spreadsheet, much of my ‘research’ has been developing procedures that work with each model, deforming books into spreadsheets and then into images in ways that will render their implicit models explicit and obvious. Rather than visualizing data, then, my goal has been to grasp models. The procedure of graphing each

bibliography amplifies Tracy’s and Frank’s choices, allowing me to see whether their distinctions are fruitful, and whether their results accord with our expectations.

            <Title>Baker: sentimental -&gt; Gothic</Title>
            <Text>I thus [return to / find evidence supporting] an older school of criticism, which saw French sentimental novels — rather than German horror stories — as the forbears of the Gothic. [Rousseau actually calls Héloïse “Gothic”!] Ernest Baker, for example, tells this kind of history in his 1929 work The History of the English Novel: Volume V, The Novel of Sentiment and the Gothic Romance:
The sources of Gothic romance… are to be sought in the popular variant of the fiction of sensibility evolved by the Abbé Prévost and elaborated later on by Baculard d’Arnaud. The exciting adventures, the violent emotions, the gloomy scenes, forests, and antres, castles, dungeons, and graveyards, in the abbés novels and the plays and stories of Baculard, were to be the distinctive features of Gothic romance through its course. It was all derivative of the cult of emotion…
In this history of the Gothic, German influences are superficial set-dressing rather than inherent to the genre:
Some novelists sought only to conjure up a witching atmosphere of awe and vague apprehension; others employed the most violent shocks of physical anguish and fear. They all dabbled in the supernatural, either playing upon or playing with feelings of superstition; and, later on, those who had become acquainted with German folk-lore and its ghosts and elves and goblins found their account in satiating the greediest appettites for crime, diabolism, and nameless horrors[.]
The Gothic is well-established before the first hints of “German folk-lore”, which only arrives “later on” and only in the works of “those who had become acquainted” with it. Even the supernatural is relevant primarily because it allows authors to manipulate readers’ “feelings of superstition” in service of the central emotional experience of fear. Baker’s historical model is not sensitive to the features of the Gothic which now draw attention — he does not make his distinctions based on politics or aesthetics or gender — instead, he defines the Gothic by its emotional manipulations.</Text>

            <Text>Philosophical Fictions and ‘Jacobin’ Novels in the 1790s
This essay on the novel of ideas in the 1790s investigates the sometimes conflicting goals pursue by the ‘Jacobin’ novelists—figures such as Mary Wollstonecraft, William Godwin, and Mary Hays—and also charts their characteristic preoccupations with the proper relations between reason and passion and mind and body. Revamping the Enlightenment tradition of the conte philosophique, these supporters of the Revolution in France and political reform in Britain advocated a newly ambitious species of novel capable of building bridges between the discursive domains of fiction and political theory. These novelists also set out to claim the power over readers’ emotions they found in sentimental fiction’s stories of suffering individuals. At the same time, contrariwise, they aimed to assemble comprehensive accounts of the social system—of ‘things as they are’, in Godwin’s phrase—and touted their commitment to the promulgation of universal, impersonal truth. 
When Godwin read Emma Courtney in draft and urged Hays to beef up its love story and so conform better to novelistic convention, she parried his criticism with a question: ‘may there not be philosophical romance?’37 Hays’s question involves the conditions of possibility for the very fictional form that she, Godwin, and their friends were seeking to invent. It signals the difficulty of their task, the recalcitrance of the prevailing understandings of the office of the novel and prevailing ways of ordering the relations between reason and desire, that the novelists so often defer to the future and future readers the recognition of this new form. These memoirists address themselves not to their contemporaries but to unknown interlocutors in the future—Caleb, for instance, to a ‘posterity’ that might render him the ‘justice which [his] contemporaries refuse’ (5)—or to the next generation—in Emma Courtney, to an adopted son, on the verge of recapitulating the book’s story of romantic abjection with another Emma; in Wrongs of Woman, to an infant daughter who may or may not be alive. History teaches us that, in the event, the generation that succeeded these novelists’ generation, retreating from the political engagement of the Revolutionary era, thwarted their hope that readers might come along whose response to their books would take the form of a political programme. In tracing these books’ passions, ambivalences, and bold experimentation, this essay has tried to suggest why a twenty-first-century audience might wish to fill that role itself.

            <Title>the teleological model</Title>
            <Text>Emotional response is salient as a distinguishing factor for Baker because he, like many of his contemporaries, writes from the teleological assumption that the history of the novel must be the history of the realist novel. Baker’s approach to the Gothic is not as obviously mediated through editorial intervention as Tracy’s or Frank’s bibliographies; as we would expect, Baker makes no explicitly deformative moves, but proceeds by discussing his various selected texts in their entirety. Nonetheless, he writes on the basis of a model of the genre’s history and its salient features. The assumptions of his model, however, remain implicit in the moralizing judgments throughout his work. Baker’s excoriation of “that amoral person [Laurence] Sterne” for being a “debauched sentimentalist” who “fondled his sensibility,” “aware of his vice, and voluptuously enjoying all its sweetness,” for example, evaluates Tristram Shandy along markedly different lines than would now be considered fruitful. J.M.S. Tompkins, too, dismisses the Gothic on the basis of [teleologically realist] assumptions: with the rise of the Gothic, she says, “the average novelist paid, on the whole, very little attention to the probability, and the novel in consequence slipped farther away from reality, as though a window on to the other world had been changed to a magic lantern.” The “magic lantern” of the Gothic is often discussed in positive terms, but [when Tompkins places “reality” as the central point from which one moves “away,” to “slip” is to make negative progress, and the enchanting lantern is rendered dangerous.] Both Baker and Tompkins model the novel itsels as a training-ground for the mind, through which habits of thought are established, and which therefore ought to inculcate the “right” mode of thought. Accordingly, both model the Gothic as a dangerously emotional and disordered mode of thought, notable not for its plots or sets or even which emotions are induced, but defined entirely by the emotionally overpowering nature of the reading experience.</Text>

“The Story of an African Farm consists of two parts, which may be regarded as a structural reflection of Schreiner’s preoccupation with contrasts – notably those between black and white, young and old, and women and men, but also those between complementary and incompatible personalities, between momentary existence and transcendental eternity, between dream and reality.” (Tigges 192)
“A specifically feminist theme of the novel becomes already quite prominent in Part One: the extremely early age at which female colonials become eligible and sought-after as marriage partners.”
“Part Two mainly relates the further development of the three young people.”
“Em, however, breaks off her engagement with Gregory, who readily transfers his attentions to the much more attractive and mystifying Lyndall.”
“Thus retold, there is little in The Story of an African Farm that suggests a utopia. Rather than with a more or less schematized and generalized blueprint of an ideal but nonexistent society, we are dealing here with an oddly constructed but realistic narrative”
“In my view, the way in which this novel was written is more important than the details of its relatively meagre and despondent plot.”
“Cherry Clayton perceptively argues how in The Story of an African Farm “true and false story-telling interweave”.”
“all of these feminist-utopian themes are personalized rather than generalized”
“Starkly delineated utopian novels in the original sense of that genre had their heyday in the idealistic late nineteenth century. The bleaker 1930s and ’40s convinced writers in the humanist tradition of the dangers of a blueprint society, and produced some memorable dystopian novels. The Story of an African Farm belongs to neither of these categories in the strict sense, and that in fact is its strength”

The decades under consideration saw the consolidation of the 'classic' fiction of Richardson, Fielding and Smollett, the publication of Sterne's Tristram Shandy, an array of secondary 'adventure' and 'spy' narratives, and the emergence of a distinctly female 'circulating library' novel. Castmg his widest net Raven manages to trawl almost 1,400 items of fiction, as opposed to the 391 and 338 items listed in McBurney and Beasley respectively. Different methods of selection and arrangement make direct comparison difficult, but Raven's book has definitely widened the scope of novel searching in a number of significant ways 
p.2: Raven notes the presence of subscription lists — a surprisingly small count of nineteen  -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
Raven also follows McBurney and Beasley in adopting a catholic view of what constitutes fiction in the period: a position matched by recent cntical studies which have stressed the pliability of the new-found genre. Critics are free to theorize, but bibliographers in Raven's position must propose some broad principles of selection and, in individual cases, bite the bullet of whether or not to include.  … Nearly three hundred titles (court memoirs, fables, voyages, political satires, essays, moral tales, but not chapbooks) are included under this heading [of ‘miscellany’]
Unlike McBurney, Raven itemizes in-period reprints of works originally published before his starting-point of 1750 — most strikingly, seventeen non- chapbook versions of RobinsonCrusoe — as well as similarly listing separately subsequent editions of new works first published in his own period to 1770. On this basis, the main listings feature more than two hundred Irish reprints. The principle of separate entries is even extended to works which appeared by volume in stages.

This highlights the continuing success of Smollett's first original work of fiction (on an edition count, Roderick Random was the fourth most popular novel in the century) and provides one of many pointers to the importance of reprinting to the contemporary trade ('classic' works by the four main male novelists account for almost seven per cent of fiction titles published in 1750-70) 
ome forgotten successes are unearthed. Charles Johnston's Chrysal; or, the Adventures of a Guinea (1760), the most prominent of a bevy of'spy' adventures, is itemized on no less than thirteen occasions, indicating a sizeable Johnston industry in the 1760s; Robert Goadby's Apologyfor the Life ofMr. Bampfylde-Moore Carew, originally published in 1745, appears no less than eight times in the checklist's 'Miscellanies' section, a ubiquitousness which is reflected in surviving circulating Library catalogues (where, by the way, it is invariably placed under 'Novels and Romances'). Also brought into view is the vogue enjoyed by certain 'elegant' feminine fictions in the 1760s. notably Mrs Frances Brooke's History ofLadyJulia Mandeville (1763; no. 769), with two new London editions and a Dublin reprinting in the year of publication, and Mrs Frances Sheridan'sMemoirsofMissSidneyBidulph(1761;no 670),whichwasevidentlygiven a new lease of life with the publication of its Conclusion along with a third edition and the same author's History ofNourjahad in 1767 (nos. 1134-38).

Overall the checklist enumerates to 1,363, to which must be added ten or so items with a suffix 'a'. By excluding 'miscellanies', Raven then narrows to a more stable base of 1,077 works of fiction. Within that reduced total there is a yet smaller group of 531 new novels 
Notwithstanding the multifariousness of publishers handling fiction, it seemed odd that the highest market share achieved by any one house in each decade was 5.4 per cent (the Nobles in the 1750s). Perhaps the root cause lies in the disparate nature of the works itemized. Take, for instance, the year 1750. From twenty-two 'new' London titles listed, only ten are of full (or multi-) volume size, out of which only three can be counted as original English works with 1750 on the imprint — two of which were published by the eminently recognizable firms of Mary Cooper and Andrew Millar! 
p.5: One solution to the problems posed might be to return to McBurney's original agenda, itemizing only full-length novels by English authors and translators at the date of first publication.

            <Title>Frank values context</Title>
            <Text>Having explored one bibliographic model in depth, we now have a point of comparison for our next model of men and women’s Gothics. Although it attempts to model the same field, Frederick Frank’s bibliography encourages a very different understanding of the texts he indexes. Unlike Tracy, Frank is interested in not just what happens, but in how it happens. His “Critical Synopsis” of each text functions entirely differently from Tracy’s “Plot Summary,” often providing very few plot details in favour of describing the work’s literary borrowings, narrative structure, and historical reception. Unlike Tracy, he includes an assessment of each work’s “Gothic type,” but these “types” are not stable overarching categories: for his 500 texts, Frank provides 309 unique classifications. In their flexibility and detail, Frank’s “types” reflect Frow’s understanding of genre: it is impossible to classify each text into the genre to which it “belongs”; instead, Frank describes the generic expectations which each text uses. His Gothic type for Sophia Lee’s The Recess, for example, labels the novel as “Gothified history (terror and sentimental elements), connecting it simultaneously to the “Gothified history” of William Godwin’s St. Leon, the “terror mode” of Radcliffe’s novels, and the “sentimental Gothic” of Charlotte Dacre’s The Libertine and The Passions. These threads cannot be traced systematically — he provides no index or definition of the types themselves. They are hardly even deterministic: The Mysteries of Ferney Castle is listed twice, once under each of its disputed authors, and receives a different Gothic type in each entry (“Pure or high Gothic (terror mode)” at entry 188 by Robert Huish, and “Gothified history (Radcliffean imitation)” at entry 222 by G. Lambe). Instead, his Gothic types model the Gothic as a shifting history, with each novel as the temporary centre of influences that stretch both forward and backward in time.</Text>
            <Comments>The two bibliographies’ treatments of Grenville Fletcher’s Rosalviva, Or, The Demon Dwarf, for example, serves as a useful illustration of their differences. Tracy’s summary is a litany of events: it begins matter-of-factly with the sentence “Leontini loves Viola di Morini, but she marries someone else,” and is equally unfazed when the titular “demon dwarf” arrives in the third act and when the dwarven appearance turns out to be false (51). Frank, in contrast, spends more than half his words on context, as in his first sentence: 
“From Rumplestilskin in the fairytale to the comic evil of Dickens’s Daniel Quilp in The Old Curiosity Shop (1841), the figure of the dwarf was often called upon to perform such demonic services as vengeance, prophecy, child possession, and transformation.” (107) 
To this broad literary history he adds Mary Shelley’s story “Transformation” as potential precursor for the disguise in Fletcher’s novel, and includes several assessments of the Gothic’s particular embellishments of “the dwarf as a resolver of dilemmas of identity” (107) and “dwarfs... spin[ning] webs of murderous intrigue for diabolic ladies” (108). All of these details stand in stark contrast to Tracy’s unembellished list of seven novels under the index entry “dwarf” (199), which treats the sinister disguise in Rosalviva as interchangeable with depictions of non-supernatural and even non-evil little people.
Most of these are “unique” primarily from the point of view of a spreadsheet: “Domestic fiction (various Gothic elements)” and “Domestic fiction (intermittent Gothic elements),” for example, are distinguished only by a slight gradation of degree. But this interest in slight qualitative gradations is what distinguishes Frank’s model from Tracy’s.</Comments>

            <Title>Developments in Sentimental Fiction</Title>
            <Text>The sentimental strain in English fiction, which represents men of feeling and women of sensibility engaging in acts of sympathy and benevolence, became prominent in the 1760s through the novels of Charlotte Lennox, Oliver Goldsmith, Laurence Sterne, Henry Mackenzie, and others, building primarily on the work of Samuel Richardson and Henry and Sarah Fielding. The reformation of male manners, the feminization of taste and consumption, the grounding of ethics in human nature rather than rationalism or faith, and the emergence of a theory of moral sensibility all contributed to the popular reception of sentimental fiction. Frances Burney’s first two novels, Evelina and Cecilia, successfully combined sentiment with the comedy of Fielding and the moral sententiousness of Richardson, but in the third, Camilla, Burney felt the pressure of an increasing taste for realism, which eventually lessened the predominance, though it did not entirely eliminate, the sentimental form. 
Sentimentalism may be defined many ways, but Burns’s letter highlights one of them: the longing after an imagined world, sometimes but not necessarily utopian or feminocentric, in which sympathy, benevolence, and goodness are the predominant virtues. 
Though the sentimentalist may profess a belief in Providence, he or she always has faith in the power of an internal monitor, whether it be ‘feeling’ or ‘the heart’ or an (p. 427) innate or acquired ‘sensibility’, to regulate the passions and conduct. Realism, on the other hand, is often distinguished by the recognition that sensibility is an unreliable, ‘irregular’ power that may need to be assisted by external law, code, or custom. 
p.2: It is difficult to fix a date by which sentimentalism became a dominant element in the English novel; in some ways, it has always been part of the genre. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
Just why the novel should have adopted sentimentalism as its defining element in the middle of the century has been the subject of extensive critical debate.6 The eighteenth (p. 428) century did see an enlarging role for women as readers and writers of fiction, but gender alone cannot account for the change of direction: works by male authors, such as Goldsmith’s The Vicar of Wakefield, Sterne’s A Sentimental Journey, Mackenzie’s The Man of Feeling, and Smollett’s The Expedition of Humphry Clinker were popular with readers of both sexes. There were other factors: the development of nerve theory brought a new conception of the body, in which feeling was elevated to an epistemological status not inferior to reason;7 the spread of nonconformity in religion placed new emphasis on the believer’s personal relationship to God and individual responsibility for moral actions; the reformation of male manners, the feminization of taste and consumption, the grounding of ethics in human nature rather than rationalism, the subversion of marriage, class, and parental authority—all these contributed to what G. J. Barker-Benfield has called a ‘culture of sensibility’ 
The most important contemporary exposition of this ideology was Adam Smith’s The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759)

The ‘man of feeling’ is one who has‘sense’ (that is to say, ‘nerve’), but whose capacity for moral action is inhibited ordisabled in some way,
The woman of sensibility … may represent either of two senses of the word ‘sensibility’: first, the ethical humanism of Sophia, who embodies the restraint, judgement, and sympathy that Hutcheson, Hume, and Smith distinguished as moral sentiments; and second, the excessively nervous sensibility of Harriot, a creature consumed by self-interest.
p.7: The woman of sensibility achieves her fullest and finest expression, prior to Jane Austen, in the works of Frances Burney.  -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
There are complex historical reasons for the decline of sentimental fiction after the 1790s. Margaret Cohen, writing about the history of the novel in France, suggests that the ‘hostile takeover’ of the genre by such realists as Balzac and Stendhal can be attributed to the need to impose order on the ‘chaos’ of literary and social relations in the early decades of the nineteenth century, a thesis that might also be applied to the English novel.36 Elizabeth Dolan finds in the works of Charlotte Smith, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Mary Shelley a shift towards ‘seeing suffering unsentimentally’, a focus on poverty, slavery, and gender oppression not merely to evoke sympathy, but to effect social change and relieve distress.37 Stephen Ahern suggests that the excesses of amatory, sentimental, and Gothic fiction that gave these novels their affective power also created ‘anxiety’ among readers and an ‘ambivalence’ among ‘authors writing fiction in the romance mode’ which eventually led to the ‘domestication’ of the form.38 The way forward for studies in sentimental fiction, however, may be not in uncovering the reasons for its decline, but in discovering the ways in which the forms of sentiment have survived, and continue to have an impact on the writing of fiction.

While by no means all of the 3,367 novels that Raven’s opening chapter records as being first published in Britain between 1750 and 1819 receive a mention, the range of different works covered in this volume is extremely impressive. The index records references to fiction by over 220 different late eighteenth and early nineteenth-century authors, as well as to numerous anonymous works. 
p.3:  because there are thirty-three essays, the volume can examine a significant number of trends and varieties of fiction as well as contexts and issues, giving attention to exactly the kinds of things that derail a simple narrative of progress.  -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
	1.	p.3: The first part, ‘Book Production and Distribution’, features the aforementioned essay by Raven on production; a fluent and interesting essay by Garside on authorship; and a clear-eyed account of lending and circulation by David Allan
	⁃	James Raven’s essay on “Production” notes, for example, that during the 1780s, many novels claimed the in uence of Frances Burney—far more than named Henry Fielding or Tobias Smollett as models
	2.	p.3: The second part—and by far the longest—covers ‘Major Authors and Traditions’. Despite this title, a focus on traditions predominates.
	⁃	Betty Schellenberg’s nuanced claims regarding the versions of female heroism written into being by Bluestocking writers, and engaging with Vivien Jones’ masterly chapter historicizing Jane Austen’s ‘allusive intelligence’
	⁃	p.3:  e “Major Authors and Traditions” section gathers fourteen essays, with ten focusing on subgenres.  e remaining four essays are devoted to the authors that the editors consider major in this period: Smollett, Laurence Sterne, Jane Austen, and Scott. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
	⁃	p.4: Smollett’s return to the foreground is evidently made possible by the collection’s particular scope and coverage, and the inclusion of ramble  fiction alongside his work brings an enormously popular (though o en neglected) group of novels back into our picture  Other subgenres that used to be considered outside the mainstream of the history of the novel also get brought forward, such as the national tale. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
	⁃	p.4: Deidre Lynch’s essay on “Early Gothic Novels and the Belief in Fiction” illustrates why this is important. Noting that gothic has always been understood to run counter to the novelistic tradition of realism, Lynch argues that early gothic actually trained readers in how to read all types of  ction, thereby supporting traditions it has been thought to problematize.Similarly, the group of three essays beginning with “Sentimental Fiction of the 1760s and 1770s,” continuing with “Bluestocking Women and Rational Female Fiction,” through “ e Novel of Sensibility in the 1780s” nicely complicates the idea of sensibility as dominating the  ction of these years by situating rational  ction by women right in the middle of sentiment.reminds us that the novel is a capacious and complicated genre that cannot be reduced to a simple linear narrative. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
	3.	p.3: The third part of the volume, ‘Generic Variations and Narrative Structures’, contains four essays that diverge from those in the previous section principally in their temporal reach. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
	4.	p.3: The fourth part, ‘Contexts’, includes only three essays.  
	5.	p.3: By contrast, the fifth part, ‘Alternative Forms of Fiction’, serves a key role as a welcome corrective to the dominance of the lengthy novel in considerations of fiction in the period. --         magazine fiction (by Gillian Hughes), the tale (Anthony Jarrells), children’s literature (M. O. Grenby) and the novel’s connections with the stage (Gillian Russell)        
	⁃	The only thing that might profitably have been added to this part is a consideration of the novel in relation to poetry, which remained a serious competitor in the realm of narrative storytelling, was practised by many of those who wrote novels and was woven through a great deal of the prose fiction published in the period.  -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
	6.	p.4: The volume’s final section, ‘Assimilation and Cultural Interchanges’, contains Michael Gamer’s excellent chapter of two halves on the novel in reviews and collections; Stephen Colclough’s typically searching thoughts on reading practices; and welcome contributions by Wil Verhoeven and Jenny Mander on global contexts and foreign imports -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017         p.4: Robert Miles’ fascinating chapter on Gothic and anti-Gothic -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

primarily a scrupulous and exemplary work of historicism, grounded in the circumstances of the period defined by its title dates. Its contributors do not generally focus a great deal of attention on making unequivocal claims regarding the aesthetic quality of the works that they examine. 
p.4: Gender, too, is present throughout the essays, as are women writers, rather than being cordoned o  in one or two essaysseveral of the contributors mention it-narratives, ramble novels, and epistolary fiction, even though each of those is the subject of a separate essay -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
Despite the numbers of novelists to which it directs new attention, this history often tacitly perpetuates existing hierarchies of value, rather than defining these or challenging them on the behalf of the works it reclaims. 
p.3: Histories of the eighteenth-century British novel have nearly always sought to explain how and why the novel transformed itself over the course of the century, and, as a result, these histories nearly always end up offering a teleological and selective account. This collection employs several strategies to avoid such a problem -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
While it is possible that a subsequent history of the novel might differentiate itself from this one by taking an explicitly aesthetic turn, it is also possible that the approaches pursued so rewardingly in this volume might be taken further with digital technologies. 
It will be interesting to see whether by the time the next large-scale history of the novel is attempted, a digital repository containing reliable versions of these texts has been created
Clifford Siskin argues for seeing the history of the novel in the eighteenth century as a complex process of emergence rather than a triumphal rise. 
p.5: Suggesting “emergence” as a more useful term than “rise” to describe the genre’s history, especially in the context of scholarship that highlights new data and a multitude of texts, Siskin brings in the idea of “novelism” from his earlier work to argue that it was this novelism— discourse of and about the novel—that ultimately generated the idea of Literature.
In this book, the history of the novel looks rather like a Pieter Bruegel the Elder painting, packed with individuals, some in the foreground and some in the background, but all presented with great detail and all, in their di erent actions, contributing to the overall e ect of the image. And it is full of life and activity.  is feels right: the history of the novel is not a uni ed narrative, but precisely the kind of diversi ed picture presented in OHNE. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

            <Title>Frank and Tracy are models</Title>
            <Text>My two ‘texts’ — bibliographies by Ann Tracy and Frederick Frank — are thus themselves models of “The Gothic Novel.” Because, as Price observes, the process of editing a text must always reveal the editor’s “unspoken assumptions about the most efficient way to convey information, and indeed what counts as information at all,” the editorial processes behind each bibliography makes each one sensitive to very different concerns. Ann Tracy’s The Gothic Novel 1790-1830: Plot Summaries and Index to Motifs emphazises dramatic events and singular images, with recurring details systematically tallied in the index. In contrast, Frederick Frank’s The First Gothics: A Critical Guide to the English Gothic Novel emphasizes each work’s overall tone and provides qualitative and subtle evaluations of its critical reception. Although only 178 works are shared between the two, they usefully complement each other in the search for gendered Gothic writing traditions. The process of computationally re-rendering each bibliography amplifies each bibliographer’s choices, allowing me to see whether their distinctions are fruitful, and whether their models point toward distinct men’s and women’s Gothics.</Text>
            <Comments>cite Price 13
The Garside bibliography, too, is a model, with its own particular concerns. It emphasizes “the full title given to the work, the imprint of the original publisher(s), and unmediated information as to how authorship was first signified,” reflecting an interest in “the ways in which novels were first projected at their readers” (“‘Ordering’ Novels: Describing Prose Fiction, 1770-1832” p. 388), and so the notes include information about dedicatees, issue variations, subscription lists, included advertisements, subsequent editions, translations, and attributions. The key editorial intervention is the inclusion of contemporary reviews. Together, these details build a model of a public sphere of letters, in which the Gothic is just one of many markets.</Comments>

            <Text>In contrast to this abundance of male-dominated tropes, female-authored tropes are elusive. The Radcliffean plot elements of subterranean passages (61% male), caves (61% male), and secret doors (59% male) turn out to be firmly correlated with male authors, not female. This is not to say that these motifs are not Radcliffean: Radcliffe alone accounts for 7% of all caves, 11% of all secret doors, and an astonishing 15% of all subterannean passages. Indeed, she is the top author for both subterranean passages and secret doors. But beyond Radcliffe, these tropes have been disproportionately adopted by men, not women. The critical emphasis on subterranean passages and caves as crucial Gothic tropes can likely be explained by who makes the “top 10” lists of their use:

Although neither motif appears widely throughout the Gothic, they repeat within the works of all four authors typically taken as the landmark writers of the genre: Walpole for the Gothic’s birth, Radcliffe and Lewis for its flourishing, and Maturin for its end. Anything prominently used by all four is surely ripe for closely-read comparison. But those comparisons illuminate more about the individual authors than the Gothic’s general usage; and, in the case of subterranean passages, they tell us more about Radcliffe than they do a women’s Gothic.</Text>

            <Title>The Gothic Novel and the Lingering Appeal of Romance</Title>
            <Text>The Gothic Novel and the Lingering Appeal of Romance
Romance, the dominant long-form fiction since 200 CE, is in eclipse for half a century after the rise of the realistic novel, but has a new efflorescence around 1790 in the Gothic novel for a number of reasons. It was a mode of historical writing without any need for accuracy about dates and places, a mode of sentimental writing that found in its villainous anti-heroes an entry point to the sadomasochistic desires of its readers. The chief characteristic of the heroine or hero is passivity, an attitude mirrored in the implied female reader of the Gothic, who seeks escape or retreat into an inner world of fantasy. It is ironic that the Gothic was displaced by 1820 by the historical romance of Scott, who adopted its plots and themes, but set them in a colder verisimilar world. 
WHILE the origins of most literary genres are lost, either in scholarly controversy or the dark backward and abysm of time, those of the Gothic novel present an admirable clarity. Beneath the papier-mâché machicolations of Strawberry Hill, the antiquarian and aesthete Horace Walpole, inspired by a nightmare involving ‘a giant hand in armour’, created at white heat the tale published at Christmas 1764 as The Castle of Otranto. Not one but two genres were thus begun. The one established first was the historical romance, which derived from elements in both Otranto and an earlier romance by Thomas Leland, Longsword, Earl of Salisbury (1762). This form was pioneered by William Hutchinson’s The Hermitage (1772), and developed by Clara Reeve (in The Champion of Virtue, 1777, retitled The Old English Baron in 1778) and Sophia Lee in The Recess (1783); it reached something like canonical status with the medieval romances of Walter Scott. 
The second, the Gothic tale of supernatural terror, was slower to erupt. The Otranto seed had time to travel to Germany and bear fruit there in the Räuber- und Ritter-romane before being regrafted on to its native English soil. It was not until the last decade of the eighteenth century that the Gothic became a major force in English fiction, so much so that tales set in Italian castles and Spanish monasteries began to crowd out those set in London houses and Hampshire mansions. Ann Radcliffe’s The Mysteries of Udolpho (1794) and Matthew Lewis’s The Monk (1796) spawned numberless imitators in a craze whose original impetus carried it into the next century. A very few were works of talent and genius, among which were Radcliffe’s The Italian (1797), Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein (1818), and Charles Robert Maturin’s Melmoth the Wanderer (1820). By then, the original impulse of the Gothic romance had played itself out, although the tale of terror was to survive as an element within and as an influence on mainstream realist fiction through the Victorian era and indeed beyond, and as a minor component of the house of fiction in both high and popular art up to the present. 
(p. 473) Such is the story of the Gothic novel, and a narrative such as this one has been retold numerous times in the critical studies of the genre that began to appear in the 1920s, by Birkhead, Railo, Tompkins, Summers, and Varma.1 But to make a necessary distinction, it is a story—or rather a chronicle, in Hayden White’s terms—and not a history. It represents the important events and major happenings in order of occurrence, but makes no claim to understand why these events occurred when they did and why others did not occur in their place, 


Attitudes towards History 

The Gothic novel thus begins with The Castle of Otranto set in medieval history, a history seen as nightmare landscape where the probabilistic strictures of the present day are absent and where anything can happen, but—partly as a result of helping to stimulate that interest in history—the Gothic of the 1790s finds the primitive past populated by genuine cultures and customs of its own. The genre is thus pushed out into a never-never land of vague otherness, elsewhere and elsewhen, where the drama of suffering can occur on its own terms.

Attitudes towards Suffering 
If the Gothic is the historical novel minus the details of the history, it might equally be thought to be a later, and more extreme, version of the sentimental novel. 
‘the sensible man feels that he is an advanced type of being, of finer clay than the rest of the world, and though he pays for his superiority by weakness and anguish, he does not find the price too high, but regards with gentle scorn the low pleasures of the unthinking world’.7 This is a basic cultural shift and not merely a literary fashion, although literature was a significant part of the cultural pattern 
In Virtue in Distress, R. F. Brissenden suggests that the ultimate collapse of the cult of sensibility came out of the growing sense that widespread misery was a function of the proper working of the economic system ….. p.7: If one accepted this vision, the classic tableau of the sentimental novel became unviewable: What moral credit, what gentlemanly self-fashioning, could lie in assisting the very poverty that had made one rich? -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

‘New Torture or Nondescript Calamity’: The Psychological Power of the Gothic 
The insertion of the villain in effect created the Gothic novel of Radcliffe in place of the sentimental novel of Mackenzie. Generically the forms are related but distinct. As David Denby put it in his study of French sentimentalism: ‘The melodramatic and the Gothic are certainly inscribed as latent possibilities in sentimentalism: in contradistinction to sentimentalism they require, perhaps, an insistence on the threat to virtue posed by a strongly personified villain, or principle of villainy, and a heightening of the obfuscation of virtue by various narrative devices, namely peripety and deceit.’13 The result was melodramatic narrative, crude but effective, as we learn from typical addicts of the Gothic like (p. 479) Catherine Morland. 
Gothic novels took two distinct forms depending on whether, structurally speaking, the protagonist is an exemplary woman (or man) or a morally reprehensible villain. The ‘female Gothic’ is a serious action—like Pamela—a melodrama arousing sympathy and suspense through the unwarranted persecution of an innocent. The ‘male Gothic’ is a punitive tragedy—like Richard III or Macbeth—in which we are made both to desire and to expect the condign punishment of the central figure. The first subgenre includes The Mysteries of Udolpho and The Italian, and countless imitators. The second includes the main plot of The Monk, sections of Melmoth the Wanderer, and Confessions of a Justified Sinner. These may exist in relatively pure form, but some Gothic novels, including The Castle of Otranto, have incorporated both plots into a mixed form whose focus shifts in different parts of the narrative. 
The most successful Gothic villains, the Montonis and Schedonis, are dark fathers, images of the demon lover or the destroying angel. Within the plot structure of the romance, these figures are frequently the heroine’s uncle—a displacement from literal fatherhood that underlines the incestuous basis of the fear and love they exact while making more probable the heroine’s terrors of violation or murder. 
In Gothic romances like The Monk and Melmoth the Wanderer, written by and largely for men, the Oedipal agon often takes the appropriately opposite form, with the male victim in thrall to a maternal woman. 
There are other significant psychological sources of narrative power in the Gothic. One stems from the perplexity and subsequent revelation of secrets and mysteries—a (p. 480) sort of rudimentary version of the pleasure we seek and find today in the detective story, which stems from the so-called phallic phase of the pre-Oedipal period. Another rather perverse pleasure has to do with the motif of imprisonment that runs through most of the important Gothic texts. The motif of confinement in the pleasurable anticipation of release, the intolerable pressures of being held in, and the incomparable pleasure of being let go, seems to be a defended form of anal eroticism. 
Probably the least well-understood and most embarrassing source of power in the Gothic romance is the stimulation it gives to the sadomasochistic desires of the implied reader. 

The Role of the Gothic Reader: The Shift to Aisthesis 
More generally, the Gothic novel sits astride a major shift in the response of the English reader to literature, a shift, in the terminology of reception theorist Hans Robert Jauss, from catharsis to aisthesis, or in basic English, a shift from reading for information, and for the sake of entry into a verisimilar world otherwise inaccessible to the reader, towards reading as an escape from the world one inhabits into an inner site of fantasy 

Page 12
Novel-reading in the late eighteenth century was gendered female, and those attacking it shifted their focus during the vogue of the Gothic. In the 1760s and 1770s it was implied that indiscriminate reading was likely to erode women’s moral principles by providing poor examples of conduct, but in the period after 1795 the anti-fiction editorial was more likely to attack reading as sapping strength of mind, wasting precious time, and calling the reader into a world whose attractions would lead her to neglect the duties and pleasures of her sublunary existence.
An empathic mindset tightly focused upon a heroine’s fears was nothing new: it had been demanded of readers by Pamela and by the sentimental novel, out of which the female Gothic developed. And yet if differences in quantity eventually make for differences in quality, the Gothic novel may have had such an impact on a major segment of the British reading public. That there was something like an addiction among the Gothic readers is suggested, not only by cautionary letters to women’s magazines but by (p. 485) the receipts from circulating libraries, which show one celebrated bluestocking going through fifty-five volumes of romance in the space of a month. 
To conclude, there were in the 1790s two very different implied readers: the first, whom clergymen and journalists of the age personified as older and male, read primarily for factual information, for the reinforcement of ethical values, and for the pleasure of recognizing the persons and things of his world; the second was personified as younger and female, receptive rather than critical, and eager to indulge in the pleasures of the imagination. And the Gothic vogue was partly self-reinforcing, in that its popularity began to draw in new classes of reader who had not formerly been a significant part of the market for literature. One major result was to pave the way for the reception of Romanticism in poetry as well as fiction, with the result that English bards—Wordsworth, Byron, and Scott, at least—despite a bit of rough handling from Scottish reviewers, were able to stir without conspicuous resistance a public that already looked to literature for the play of fantasy, dream, and desire. The second result was in the Gothic itself, which after 1810 tended to abandon the historical themes of Radcliffe for the more explicitly fantastic imaginative worlds of Mary Shelley and Charles Robert Maturin. By then the Gothic wave itself had already begun to recede, leaving in its ebb two masterpieces, Frankenstein (1818) and Melmoth the Wanderer (1820). While the Gothic was to rise again, first with the Brontës, and later, at the end of the nineteenth century, with the supernatural tales of Stevenson, James, Wilde, and Stoker, the romance of Radcliffe was at an end, destroyed, ironically, by that arch-romantic poet, Walter Scott. 
Scott and the End of the Gothic 
The popularity of Scott and historical romances like his was immense, because in effect Scott had, by his use of realistic detail, licensed male readers to enjoy the romance, which otherwise they had despised—or pretended to despise—as feminine aesthetic experience. But even as males were joining enthusiastically the ranks of the readers of romance, romance itself had been forced to change, to leave the realms of fantasy for the concrete and the historical. Publishers would reject the outworn Gothic novel, with its principally female readership, for the historical romance, whose mixed appeal was broader and therefore more profitable. But in generating a new and even larger audience for romance, Scott had given the Gothic novel of the Radcliffe era its deathblow.

            <Title>2005 Garside J. F. Hughes and the Publication of Popular Fiction, 1803-1810</Title>
            <Text>THE HISTORY OF POPULAR FICTION in the Romantic period is often associated with the careers of two entrepreneur-publishers, William Lane and Henry Colburn. The prolific output of novels by Lane, and his successor A. K. Newman, is described in considerable detail in Dorothy Blakey's The Minerva Press, 1790-1820 (London, 1939). Colburn's promin- ence as a publisher of fashionable novels in the 1820s has also been sketched out in Matthew Whiting Rosa's The Silver-Fork School (New York, 1936)
With issues of this kind in mind, in the last few years I have been constructing a comprehensive file of novels published between 1780 and 1830: employing sources contemporary with the period—circulating library catalogues, William Bent's London Catalogue, listings in reviews — alongside more modern library catalogues and bibliographical compilations. The result is a collection of almost three thousand original titles (reprints, miscellanies, and shorter tales are generally excluded), with in most instances a note of the publisherofthefirstedition. 
Notunexpectedly,theresultsservetoconfirm several presuppositions about the Minerva Press and Colburn 
 Lane's rise to pre-eminence coincides with a large upsurge in titles in the late 1780s, and the Minerva's dominance in this respect continued almost unabated until the 1820s. In all but three years (1807, 1808, and 1818) Lane and/or Newman were responsible for at least 25% of new titles — and on two occasions, in 1795 and 1801, Lane actually claimed more than half of the annual total. Colburn's contribution begins with a trickle in 1806, and develops only slightly in numerical terms until the floodgates open after the financial crisis of 1825/26. From then to the end of the decade Colburn effectively replaced the Minerva by publishing at least 25% of new titles, culminating with exactly half (thirty-four out of sixty-eight) in 1829. Other publishers — for example, Hookham in the last two decades of the eighteenth century, or Longmans early in the nineteenth —took a clear stake in fiction, but only one can be said to have dominated in a way comparable to Lane and Colburn. From 1807-08 J. F. Hughes of Wigmore Street, Cavendish Square, claimed his own quarter share of titles, outstripping in both years the Minerva Press, which was experiencing something of an ebb in its fortunes during the transfer of control from Lane to Newman.
If a handful of titles on the border between fiction and scandalous memoir are included, the number so far noted of novels published by Hughes, … totals exactly one hundred 
p.17: The tide of taste, likewise, was beginning to turn. Hannah More's Coelebs in Search ofa Wife (1808), which had reached twelve editions by the end of 1809, signalled the start of an evangelical assault on 'fashionable' life and literature. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017
p.19: In Hughes's output it is possible to trace an accelerating movement, sometimes involving the same authors, from sentimental and Radcliffian pot-boilers, though anglicized schauerroman and Monk-like horror, to 'fashionable' anecdote and scandal. At the same time, it is important to bear in mind that Gothic and sentimental novels continued as mainstays of his production to the end. Of sixty-four titles examined at first hand, the majority fall in almost equal proportions into the broad categories of sentimental, Gothic, and scandal fiction. The list is completed by a smattering of 'historical' novels (though the distinction between these and the Gothic and/or sentimental is sometimes blurred), and two late pseudo-Irish works. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

            <Title>Literary scholars grappling with methods of non-symptomatic</Title>
            <Text>Literary scholars grappling with methods of non-symptomatic reading often glancingly reference computational methods, but equally often do so without engaging at length with the ways that these methods do or do not align with non-computational ways of reading. Computational models of literary texts offer interpretive meaning not because computers are imbued with a unique empiricial objectivity, but because they facilitate an alternate way of attending to humanistic concerns. The difference is one of degree, not fundamental kind: indeed, resistance to symptomatic reading is itself founded in an awareness that all literary interpretation relies, in some way, upon modelling the text in question. Even a paragraph may easily exceed our ability to recall and respond to its entirety as a whole: as Freedgood and Schmitt note, even as we read a novel we are substituting “a conceptual ‘gist’” for its particularities (9). Schmitt and Freedgood respond by advocating a method of reading which refuses to gloss over any detail, treating each word as a potential site of intense meaning. Distant reading, particularly as practiced by Franco Moretti, responds to the same problem by treating no word as a site of meaning, relocating the meaning to the overall pattern of the work’s ebbs and flows. Despite the opposition embedded in the terminology of “distant” versus “close” reading, however, computational modelling offers a rich toolset to achieve the attention to the “variegated” dissonances of literary texts which Heather Love’s discussion of “thin description” argues for (378). Moreover, computational modelling almost guarantees the experience of surprise that Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick considers a prerequisite for the escape of paranoid reading, a particularly pernicious way of reading symptomatically. Taking Olive Schreiner’s The Story of an African Farm as its object of study, this essay will model an approach to interpretation which takes its cues from iterative prototyping.

Passing between Victorian novel of manners and long stretches of allegory, political and religious philosophy, the novel as a whole presents a rich object that resists a singular interpretive approach. The appeal of a model, then, is that it can somehow respond to, rather than anticipate, the rich variation of the novel. Willard McCarty defines modelling in all fields as a “consciously simplifying act of interpretation” which aims to “make tractable or manipulable what the modeller regards as interesting” (n.pag); we must define from the outset both what we regard as interesting, how our simplifications operate permissibly to illuminate those interesting aspects, and why these elements could not be tractable in other ways.
 In the case of The Story of an African Farm, I turn my attention to the seemingly basic question of who is present, when, and with whom. Like nearly all features of a novel, these appearances and disappearances are not readily tractable in other ways because of the distorted prominence that individual scenes or traits are given in our memories.

 I hypothesized that Waldo provides an emotional baseline against which the more traditionally plotted story of Lyndall and Em operates, and sought to discover whether such a thing was modelable.
By entering with a hypothesis, I set myself up for a surprise. The initial driving question is necessary, in order to decide what to make the model itself sensitive to, but the actual answer is terrifyingly lacking in a guaranteed meaning.  Sometimes it is a specific hypothesis that is disproved, something like “subterranean passages are largely the province of female writers in the early Gothic”; in these cases, it can still be very exciting to be surprised with the discovery that “subterranean passages are largely the province of male writers”. But one is also at risk of finding null results to such hypotheses as “subgenres can be detected by these means” or “social networks will be comprehensible.” McCarty is quite sanguine that, “however unwelcome surprises may be to granting agencies,” “failure to give us what we expect is by far the most important result”: the understanding is only usefully new, by definition, if we did not know it when we started (n. pag.). McCarty provides encouragement to design models that are likely to be “fruitful,” by which he means, focusing intense time and energy on experiments that are likely to be surprising, often unpleasantly. In encouraging us to design for failure, McCarty presents modelling in a way that renders it an alternative to paranoid reading. Sedgwick argues that paranoid readings,  which “requires that bad news be always already known” (130), minimizes negative affect but also rules out the pursuit of positive affect as a potential goal. In seeking alternatives to paranoid reading, she further argues that bad surprises must be possible for good surprises to be meaningful. For Sedgwick, this means approaching texts without the assumption that they are always already going to reveal horrors, in order to allow reparative affective to emerge instead. In modelling, the potential for surprise enters not when we are assessing what something means, but even before then, when we are determining what it is, and whether we’ve gotten a good look at it.
It is in this embrace of surprising failure that the computational humanist, far from bearing the shining light of empiricism from the privileged realm of the sciences, must always be prepared to discover that either the way you modelled was wrong, or the thing you thought was wrong. Research-through-modelling requires a constant suspension of I-don’t-know-yet. It also requires, as McCarty notes, a “a forbidding amount of Sitzfleisch”: unglamorous stretches of time spent persevering through monotonous tasks (n. pag.). The simple appeal of a computational model, after all, is that it may be exhaustive: computer memory can store more than human memory, and can evaluate the “whole” thing at once. It is of course impossible to see a whole whole, but in attempting to define a way of being exhaustive, this method may permit the visibility of a whole part. Moretti has used the metaphor of an X-ray, which occludes the many details of soft tissues and organs to reveal the bones (4). But despite the rhetoric of revelation, the key skill that the scholar provides in these situations is more usually patience than brilliance. Producing, for example, a detailed breakdown of which characters co-occupy the ‘narrative present’ of Story of an African Farm (Figure 1) might easily take forty-five minutes per chapter. But this twenty hour task of writing down who is there and who is not, despite appearing on its face to require no intellectual engagement, in fact relies on very human interpretations which would take far more than twenty hours of a skilled computer scientist to approximate. These operations are easily concealed— Moretti is often frustratingly closemouthed about the hows of his choices—  but we can borrow “methodology” sections from the sciences: not because the sciences have privileged access to objectivity and truth, but because these attempts to account for our operations usefully expose the limits of the conclusions we draw. By addressing honestly the limits of our guesses, and by refusing either to conceal or glamorize the work of research, the operations of the critic may be made comprehensible and replicable.

The process of modelling and iteration, then, becomes fruitful when it forces a researcher to, in some way, account for everything that happens within a given domain. In this instance, rather than making a map and then journeying back to delve deeper into a separate object, the process of modelling is one of travelling more and more carefully over the graspable features of that object — using the text as a guide to the absences in the map, and examining critically the map’s increasingly complex surface
A model, especially a visual one, then, attains its force not by cleanly unifying its subject in an elegant system, but by rendering tractable, in some fashion, “the real variety that is already there” (Love) in its most obvious features.</Text>

            <Title>this CRIES OUT for correlation</Title>
            <Text>Attempting to compare the two models raises the prospect of combining them. It’s been an open question to this point whether Frank’s Gothic types respond to actually gendered usage, or impose their interpretations based on subsequent gendered expectation. When it comes to assessing a work as “polemical” versus “didactic”, for example, the tone difference is a subjective interpretation which could easily be influenced by his knowledge of the author’s gender. In contrast, Tracy’s boolean motifs — although they may be prone to false negatives, and are certainly vague in interpretive detail — are at least safe from these interpretive false positives. We can thus evaluate the potentially-gendered basis of Frank’s type assessments by considering the motifs associated with each tag. Because, as we saw earlier, Tracy’s motifs only render certain kinds of literary features visible, we are now doubly prone to false negatives. However, we can still hope for some true positives. In correlating the two bibliographies, I narrow my attention to the 178 texts included in both works, and ask: does knowing Frank gave a work a certain tag tell us anything about what motifs it probably has? In particular, can the “horror” and “terror” tags be distinguished from each other and from the mainstream by particular motifs?</Text>

            <Text>“Moretti has experimented with scientific and social-scientific methods, including mapping, systems theory, the statistical analysis of genres, evolutionary modeling to account for liter- ary competition, and cognitive methods. The most pointed and salient of his interventions has been his forwarding of the method of distant reading.13 As an explicit refusal of the key method in literary studies, Moretti’s embrace of reading from a distance should be understood as both a departure from traditional hermeneutics and a shift in the habitus of literary critical practice. Drawing on the tactics of the Annales School as well as of quantitative sociology, and borrowing on a model of collaboration current in the sciences, Moretti argues for the importance of scholarship at “second hand.” Distant reading refuses the richness of the singular literary text in favor of the production of knowledge on an enlarged scale. By sacrificing richness—and turning it into data—he is able to handle greater quantities of material, and to observe literature as a vast geographical and historical system. Moretti is clear about what is to be gained through a refusal of the messy intimacies of traditional forms of humanistic inquiry: scientific authority, generality, knowledge, legitimacy. He is also clear that it will entail losses: richness, singularity, exceptionality, the text. In refusing the “theological exercise” of close, sustained textual analysis, Moretti also turns away from the intimacy of ethical pedagogy, mediated, as Hunter suggests, through a sustained encounter with an exemplary literary text.” (374)</Text>

p.15: A Sentimental Journey clearly belongs to its time insofar as it joins contemporary debates about the social virtues and the ethical dimension of feeling, but where Tristram Shandy is in part, as Booth puts it, the ‘product of the novels that were published as [Sterne] was maturing his own methods’,71 it stands out from other novels of the 1760s in ways which support his sense of it as ‘something new, quite out of the beaten track’. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017

p.15: To read Tristram Shandy and A Sentimental Journey in the context of mid-eighteenthcentury fiction, is not to explain away their complexities and idiosyncrasies, nor to diminish Sterne’s achievement in conceiving and producing his ‘extraordinary’ books. Doing so, however, enables us to see him meaningfully as a writer of his time who made a significant contribution to the novel form. If such a statement sounds blindingly obvious, it has not generally been perceived as such in the history of Sterne’s critical reception, or, indeed, in accounts of the ‘rise’ of the novel. -- Highlighted Apr 22, 2017</Text>

            <Title>my model of Frank</Title>
            <Text>Adapting Frank’s model for my own, then, required working somewhat against the grain of his assumptions. However, I have avoided simply assigning each text one simple genre. Instead, I have separated out each strand of influence within his complex “Gothic types”  by dividing each “type” into a set of tags, and tallied the uses of each tag. This process generated 190 unique tags, most of which only applied to one or two works. By rendering the tags individually listable, my model imposes a more systematic ontology than Frank’s. However, because each work is “tagged” numerous times, my model retains the details of each work’s often-idiosyncratic combinations of influences. My approach treats each “tag” as an independent object of inquiry, informative on its own regarding one small facet of a work’s participation in its generic context. I ask whether the association of a given tag with a work constitutes meaningful information regarding the probable gender of that work’s author. Because Frank’s classifications are subjective assessments, an answer of “yes” to this question could have two meanings. When we find, for example, that the “sentimental” tag predicts female authorship, this could indicate either that women really did write more sentimental novels, or that certain common features of the Gothic are more likely to be called sentimental when women write them. Correlating genre tags with less ambiguous features of the work — such as the inclusion of particular motifs — will, later, allow us to examine to what extent Frank is responding to differences in authorial usage. But regardless of their basis, Frank’s assessments are informative about the horizon of critical expectations. Frank’s model of the multiplicity of Gothic subgenres, in the reverse of Tracy, shows an identifiable women’s Gothic, whereas the men’s Gothic is elusive.</Text>
            <Comments>First, Frank’s phrases were split so that each word became one tag. Radcliffe’s The Italian, listed as “Pure or high Gothic (terror and horror modes)” becomes “Pure”, “or”, “high”, “Gothic”, “terror”, “horror”, and “modes.” Then, conjunctions were deleted, and synonyms combined. Frank always uses the phrase “Pure or high” in its entirety, for example, so the tags “Pure”, “or”, and “high” were merged into one tag “Pure;high”. </Comments>

            <Title>some horror motifs</Title>
            <Text>The “horror” tag, certainly, is associated with a number of motifs. Predictably, too, the “horror” motifs look similar to the men’s motifs. At the top of the list of “horror” motifs is “Inquisition” — 63% of “horror” Gothics include the Inquisition, an enormous increase over the baseline 15% presence of that motif. This striking result lends credence to the work of scholars like Robert Miles who take conspiracy as a central horror-Gothic concern. Next, less expectedly, are secret doors, at the exact same level of increase — 48% more secret doors in “horror” novels than in the corpus as a whole. “Horror” Gothics also have 47% more prophetic dreams, 46% more corpses, 40% more drugging, and 39% more banishment than the corpus as a whole. These motifs remain distinctly associated with “horror” when we instead compare “horror” directly to “terror,” rather than comparing the corpus as a whole: all of these occur two to three times more often with the “horror” tag than with “terror”. Horror and terror are most sharply distinguished from each other, though, by “actual incest”, which occurs five times more often with “horror” than with “terror”. As when Tracy was considered alone, this minor motif has strong predictive power. The next strongest distinguishing motifs are “Satan and lesser demons” and “loose woman”, both of which appear four times more frequently in “horror” than in “terror”. Three times more frequent in “horror” works are “rape”, “pre-nuptial death”, and “banishment.” All of these motifs paint a distinct horror tradition, which our earlier models also allow us to see as male. But they also complicate our understanding of “horror” by introducing motifs which were previously not male-dominated enough to become part of the categorical definition.</Text>
            <Comments>Interestingly, this represents 3 “horror” tagged works and 2 “terror” tagged works. One of those “terror” works is Matthew Lewis’s The Monk, which is tagged as both “horror” and “terror”, but the other is Ancient Records, Or, The Abbey Of Saint Oswythe, by T. J. Horsley Curties, which is only tagged “terror”. Two other works containing “incest, actual” are not tagged as either “horror” nor “terror”. Having reached clusters of only two or three texts, however, these samples are too small to bear sustained statistical scrutiny.</Comments>

            <Text>Love turns to sociological microanalysis as a model for 'thin description' close-but-not-deep reading methods … I propose (qualitative?) macroanalysis as another model which seeks the same goals

“Some literary critics have responded to the declining fortunes of textuality by renewing their commitment to the discipline.3 Alongside such responses, however, critics have also responded by displacing the text from the center of literary studies.” (403)
“In addition, in recent debates on method, critics have elaborated arguments for modes of reading that seem polemically aimed against the disciplinary core of the field (as in Franco Moretti’s account of “distant reading” [2000: 57]). It seems that those dense webs of significance are not as significant as they used to be.”
“I argue that literary studies might forge an expanded defense of reading by considering practices of exhaustive, thin description undertaken in proximate disciplines.” (404)
“Through its exhaustive, fine-grained attention to phenomena, thin description offers a model for close reading after the decline of the linguistic turn.” (404) 
—&gt; it also lends itself well to recombination by future critics; in many ways what these bibliographies have provided is “thin description”!


The wink is a failure if its intended recipient does not see it; or sees it but does not know or forgets the code; or misconstrues it; or disobeys or disbelieves it; or if anyone else spots it. A mere twitch, on the other hand, is neither a failure nor a success; it has no intended recipient; it is not meant to be unwitnessed by anybody; it carries no message. It may be a symptom but it is not a signal. The winker could not not know that he was winking; but the victim of the twitch might be quite unaware of his twitch. (406)

“Thin description means, in effect, taking up the position of the device; by turning oneself into a camera, one could—at least ideally—pay equal attention to every aspect of a scene that is available to the senses and record it faithfully.” (407)
“(the reductionist account is a true account, though not the only possible one)” (408)

“. Moretti’s concept of “distant reading” as well as approaches in book history and humanities computing sidestep hermeneutics and familiar modes of contextualization associated with thick description and various historicisms. Treating the book as a material object, a commodity, or a social fact, these methods put books back in contact with hard surfaces of life including trade, industry, craft traditions, marketplaces, publics, geography, and discourse networks.” (411)

surface reading remains attentive (or even hyperattentive) to the text itself. Surface reading makes reading central, but it focuses on aspects of texts often seen as too obvious to be of interest. In this sense, it is descriptive: it defers virtuosic interpretation in order to attempt to formulate an accurate account of what the text is like.  (412)
“By foregrounding observation and description, I suggest that we can better account for all the things that texts are—the way they appear, how they behave, what they communicate. In addition, such an approach illuminates the merely descriptive features of literary texts and the complex links between texts and social worlds.”  (412)

“With the practical difficulties it poses, the specific nature of the objects of analysis (interactional dynamics in everyday situations), and the exhaustive description and coding of highly uneventful samples of experience, it could end up being what it sounds like, which is to say, really boring. The anxiety that exhaustive descriptive could be exhausting— time-consuming and tiresome—underwrites a lot of negative responses…” (418)

“Data and details, thin and thick description, come together in the microanalytic tradition, which provides a model of slow, detailed reading.” (419)

a difference between asking “What is it that's going on here?" (421) and “What is it that is /really/ going on here?” (422)

“To try to find out what it is that is going on in a text is to ignore the key constraints and affordances of the literary: irony, fictionality, layering of perspective, genre, plotting, and so / on” (426-7)

“Detextualization need not exclude interpretation, but it could also make room for other practices such as description, observation, and natural history, as well as testing, polling, and coding. […] Taking up the descriptive methods of the postwar microanalysis makes it possible to challenge narrow hermeneutic definitions of reading. Instead, such practices might help us reframe reading as a social science, one that along with more traditional social scientific methods can contribute to the project of showing “what the real world is really like.”” (430)</Text>

            <Text>Frank’s women’s Gothic challenges few stereotypes of women’s writing. Like Tracy, he indexes slightly more female authors than male. Three of the most popular tags are even more female-dominated than his woman-heavy sample would lead us to expect: 43% of Frank’s corpus is written by women, but that 43% is responsible for 50% of the “terror” works, 65% of the “Radcliffean” works, and a striking 77% of the “sentimental.” Contemporary criticism has worked to revise the eighteenth-century consensus that the literary sphere was overtaken with a flood of dangerous sentimental literature by and for women: Barbara Benedict, for example, ruthlessly debunks a range of “manifestly untrue” eighteenth-century perceptions of reading demographics, and many others have agreed that most readers and most writers were men, and even that men and women mostly read the same things. However, the preponderance of women writing Frank’s sentimental works suggests a kernel of truth underlying eighteenth-century critics’ panic. It is entirely possible for readers to be mostly male, and authors mostly male, even within the sphere of specifically Gothic publishing, but for female authors to nonetheless write a detectably feminine kind of book. Frank presents us with a Radcliffean, sentimental, terror Gothic which is also a women’s Gothic. This women’s Gothic is exactly the sort subgenre which would be invisible in Tracy’s model, because it doesn’t operate by identifiable motif. If we turn away from a serch for privileged subject matter which only women will think to describe — not subterranean passages or blood — and instead observe the less-quantifiable intangibles that Frank uses — tone, attitude, aesthetics — then we can find a broadly popular women’s Gothic.</Text>

            <Text>My method has been, in its assumptions, necessarily historicist — sensitive not to retroactive critical distinctions, but attempting to describe a body of works as it relates to itself. I have chosen not to ask what qualities will cause a novel to be categorized by my bibliographers as ‘Gothic,’ but rather what constitutes ‘normal’ within this pool. In doing so, I have found evidence at various points of both a Male Gothic and a Female Gothic that are in keeping with some critical conceptions. However, I remain persuaded that the most striking result is the large body of works that fall into neither category, and the unbalanced or awkwardly non-parallel nature of any binary distinctions one might wish to draw. McCarty argues that “a good model can be fruitful in two ways: either by fulfilling our expectations, and so strengthening its theoretical basis, or by violating them, and so bringing that basis into question” — of these, he says, “failure to give us what we expect is by far the more important result” (McCarty). Accordingly, my failure to find a an obvious or stable gender divide within the Gothic is valuable as evidence that in the broadest context of the Gothic, the conversation occurring between novels is not driven by authorial gender.</Text>

            <Text>The Popular Novel, 1790–1820
The ‘popular novel’ was variously defined and understood in the period 1790 to 1820, but the Minerva Press was and has been seen, usually negatively, as its major purveyor. Recent research has substantially corrected and complicated this view, and indicated the varieties of novels and of their popularity and uses during that time. In the onset of modernization and its attendant changes, conflicts, and crises, various kinds of novels, perhaps more than other literary forms, helped their various kinds of readers to understand, negotiate, and learn how to manage both modernization and the anxieties of an age of revolutions. In that process, the novel itself underwent revolutionary change and diversification to become the dominant and mainstream form still used today. 
Through the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, ‘modern novel’ usually referred to the contemporary novel of sensibility or novel of manners, sentiment, and emulation 
By this time, too, a history of the ‘modern novel’ emerged attributing its invention to Samuel Richardson and casting it as the expression and promoter of a popular—here, middle-class—culture, ethos, and will, in a democratizing process of economic, social, cultural, and political ‘progress’, drawing national pride from European writers’ known enthusiasm for Richardson.

Despite this progressive view of the ‘modern novel’, most commentators—and even modern novelists—used the phrase pejoratively, to mean ‘popular’ in the sense of widely read, adapted to ‘common’ understandings and tastes, and cheap of access. In a 1791 review it was depicted as a mere formula, concocted to a ‘recipe’, ‘manufactured’ like cheap cotton goods, or recycled from second-hand material. 
It was generally assumed that the ‘modern novel’ was a ‘circulating library novel’, and the terms were interchangeable. By the 1790s it was a commonplace that circulating library novels were at best ‘silly’, and more likely ‘pernicious’. 
That the circulating library novel was popular, for better or, usually, worse, was assumed. The association was closely commercial: most of a new novel’s typical print run of a few hundred copies would be purchased by circulating libraries; prominent library proprietors also published novels. 
Some modern research suggests that novels were not always the largest proportion of circulating library stock, but at the time it was believed they were. Even if novel titles did not outnumber others in library catalogues, actual borrowings could, since a single novel title might represent numerous copies for the fleeting but intense demand of the ‘season’. 
As the conservative Blackwood’s Magazine thundered (p. 510) in 1818: ‘The reader who is capable of understanding Cervantes, Fielding, and Voltaire, is not likely to be a great patron of the Minerva Press; and vice versa, the consumers of the Minerva Press ware have no relish for any of the great works of fiction, either in poetry or prose.’18 Similar aspersions were repeated for two centuries.19 
What, then, of practice at the time? What novels did most people read? Where did they get them? Where did they come from? And—most important—how did readers use them in everyday life? 
The consensus then and since, that most circulating libraries stocked novels that were formula escapist ‘trash’ largely by women and for women and servants, is being modified by new quantitative and qualitative research. This finds that the circulating library novel trade was diverse, ranging from J. F. Hughes through the Minerva Press to Henry (p. 511) Colburn, and ingenious in its methods, innovative in its products, and knowledgeable about competition and readership.21 Almost 30 per cent of the Minerva Press list was not novels. Though women outnumbered its men authors there were many of the latter, there were about as many novels with male as female protagonists, and many novels show sophisticated awareness of gender stereotypes. Many of its novels were at least as well written as the standard fiction of the day, and there was good variety of subgenres, including ‘courtship’, ‘didactic’, ‘epistolary’, ‘Gothic’, ‘Gothic elements’, ‘sentimental’, ‘wedlock’, ‘historical’, ‘chivalric’, ‘development/Bildungsroman’, ‘(auto)biography/memoirs’, ‘generational’, and various combinations. Many Minerva Press novels referred to contemporary issues and events, though cultural and literary references were mainly from common knowledge. Their predominantly middle-class readership often preferred to read about characters somewhat above themselves in social rank and set in unfamiliar or exotic locales, but many novels were preoccupied with questions of personal identity and social location and relationships.22 Such traits indicate not escapism and fantasy but interest in practical issues of real life in the onset of modernity. 
Meanwhile, most novels that were popular in the sense of cheap were sold either complete as sixpenny chapbooks or pamphlets or divided in sixpenny periodical numbers or parts.25 
Complete sixpenny chapbook novels, comprising less than a dozen to several dozen pages of small type, were of two kinds, old favourites and ostensible novelties. 

The myth informing many or most popular/modern novels was the identity-mystery romance, extending from Tom Jones to Fatherless Fanny to Oliver Twist and beyond. This took diverse forms but its core was a plot of exile, recognition, and return.
This myth had many variations from Tom Jones to Fatherless Fanny, including self- misrecognition from Lennox and Graves to Austen and Scott, social misrecognition in sentimental and Gothic novels from Walpole and Reeve to Smith and Radcliffe, moral and social misrecognition in Burney and Austen, social-political persecution in Godwin’s Caleb Williams and Wollstonecraft’s Wrongs of Woman, misrepresentation in Newgate and ‘Silver Fork’ novels of the 1820s and 1830s, and so on. Whatever the variant, whether found in owned or rented novels, in sixpenny-chapbook or full-length format, this myth had to be reread, repeatedly re-engaged, hence making certain novels ‘popular’, because the conditions the myth addressed continued central to novel readers’ real material interests. It was not the only myth readable into the popular novels of these decades, but it was comprehensive, central, powerful, and adaptable and may well, as contemporary commentators like Barbauld suggested, have helped its readers imagine, desire, pursue, and assume what they saw as their ‘rightful’ place in the emergent modern state.

            <Text>Having declared an interest in eighteenth century novels and bibliographic research, Peter Garside and James Raven’s monumental The English Novel, 1770–1829 immediately demands consideration. Lee Erickson aptly called it “magnificent” for its scope. But is is Garside’s scope which works against this project; instead, I will use two earlier bibliographies, by Ann Tracy and Frederick Frank, which are more partial, qualitative, and idiosyncratic — features which may not recommend a bibliography as a general reference, but which make them rich subjects for modelling. Both works’ basic bibliographical data is duplicated in Garside, but both also offer substantial qualitative descriptions of the works they list, including summaries of their contents. Ann Tracy indexes 208 works from the years 1753-1857, of which 103 are by female authors, 95 by male, and only 10 unknown. Frederick Frank indexes 499 works published in the years 1753 to 1835 (with one outlier by Beckford not published until 1912). 215 of Frank’s authors are female, 156 male, and 128 unknown. Because each bibliographer excludes some works which are included by the other, they provide information about 529 unique texts, but only 178 works are indexed in both bibliographies.  Both show substantially higher counts of female authorship, and lower counts of anonymous authorship, than were typical of novels as a whole. This over-representation of women might be selection bias, or it might reflect some underlying reality to the period’s assumption that women wrote Gothics; this paper won’t answer that question, but will instead statistically normalize raw book counts.</Text>
            <Comments>CITE review Modern Philology, Vol. 101, No. 4 (May 2004), pp. 622-626
Indeed, each works’ basic bibliographical data is improved in the Garside— one of my early steps was to check both Frank and Tracy against Garside, which allowed me to correct some errors in publication dates and titles, and revealed a handful of new authorship attributions for unsigned works. Except for the authorship attributions, these differences have no impact on my experiments, but all discrepancies between Frank or Tracy and Garside have been silently amended in favour of Garside.
Although she includes a few works that are chronological outliers, Tracy’s emphasis is firmly on the years indicated on her title, 1790-1830

            <Title>Frank-and-Tracy-based conclusion</Title>
            <Text>This correlation confirms a conclusion drawn from examining just Tracy’s motifs, that the men’s Gothic might operate via striking images but the women’s Gothic less so. Men’s horror is a minor tradition within the genre, easy to single out for censure but not the most widely-imitated. Men’s and women’s schools do indeed exist, but that they do not map neatly to a set of female/male terror/horror Radcliffe/Lewis binaries, and that both gendered schools are dwarfed by a largely non-gendered Gothic mainstream. These findings serve as a a useful reminder that not all contrasts are perfect binaries; the existence of a men’s Gothic tradition does not require that everything outside that tradition be a perfectly-opposed women’s Gothic. They also suggest that, when we are seduced by the scenery of the Gothic, we end up paying attention to only a minor thread within it — men’s horror Gothics — at the expense of less-graspable but equally-crucial features which better define the mainstream.</Text>

            <Text>A men’s Gothic is more elusive in Frank’s model. Like in Tracy, the men’s tags generally apply only to very few novels, reflecting a minor tradition. Unlike in Tracy, there are very few of these minor men’s tags. The ones that do exist reinforce the conclusions we drew more strongly based on Tracy’s model. Men outnumber women in the “Germanic” tag (which encompasses “German”, “Germanic”, “Schauerroman”, “Rauberroman”, and “Ritterroman”) — of these 29 Germanic Gothics, 18 are by men (62%). “Horror”, too, is disproportionately male: 42% of “horror” works are by men, a porportion that is solidly above their baseline 31%, though not astonishing. “Lewisite” is about the same (46% male). More strikingly male-dominated are two characteristics which would be invisible in Tracy’s motif-focused view: “polemical” and “prototypical” works. 12 works are identified as “proto” or “early” forms of something else; of those 12, 7 are by men (58%). A slightly larger group of works exists with the tags “polemical,” “philosophical,” “political,” and “radical/revolutionary” — of these 19, 13 are by men (68%). The highest male percentage that applies to more than one work is for “polemical” Gothics, which fiercely flog some viewpoint or another: 83% of the six “polemical” works are by men. The masculine assessment of “polemical” works is particularly suggestive in light of the numbers for “didactic” works, which are entirely neutral (50% each). “Didactic” works are the only works with a persuasive agenda in which men do not dominate, suggesting a qualitative distinction: men can produce confrontational political works, whereas the didactic is a more equal-opportunity field in which women, too, can promote their ideas under the aegis of instruction. Whether the gendered distinction comes from the eighteenth century or the twenty-first, Frank’s model has added an additional dimension to the conclusion we drew from Tracy, that male authors can choose their subject matter more freely.</Text>

            <Title>mainstream Gothic</Title>
            <Text>Frank’s Gothic mainstream is largely non-gendered. The two most prevalent tags in the corpus as a whole, representing all Gothics without attention paid to authorial gender, are “Gothic” (83% of all works) and “pure/high” (39%), both of which have the same gendered distribution of the sample as a whole. Our only hint of a gendered trend among the most widespread tags is the third most prevalent tag, “terror” (34% of works), which, at 50% female, is somewhat above the female baseline of 43%. The next two tags in prominence are not informative about genre variation, but instead highlight the multiplicity of Frank’s assessments: the tags “mode” and “elements” are each applied to 27% of all works in the sample. These terms generally appear as qualifiers for his other assessments, as in “terror mode” or “sentimental elements,” and accordingly remind us to modify the implied force of “terror” and “sentimental” as tags. Indeed, many of Frank’s tags are essentially qualifiers: “mode”, “effects”, “Gothified”, and “imitation,” for example. In Frank’s Gothic typology, then, the Gothic is not monolithic: each work assembles multiple elements, which have their sources elsewhere, and are all interconnected. Nothing for Frank is just one genre. Even horror and terror are far from mutually exclusive. Of the 53 “horror” works, 26 (49%) are also tagged “terror”. These 26 are 50% by men, making the horror-terror mode more predictive of male authorship than horror alone. Of the remaining 27 works which are purely horror, no terror, there are 9 by women, 9 by men, and 9 unknown — a far cry from the horror Gothic as the exclusive province of men. This is the reverse of Tracy — Tracy showed a male horror and equal-opportunity terror mainstream; Frank shows equal-opportunity horror, and female terror. Between the two, the only part that’s consistent is that terror vastly outnumbers horror. There are gendered currents, but none of them are striking enough to start making predictions about the many unsigned works.</Text>

            <Text>The “terror” tag, as expected, is less strongly defined by its motifs. Several motifs do appear with slightly higher frequency within “terror” works than in the baseline, but generally only by a few percentage points. 43 motifs appear in “horror” works with a 20% or greater increase in frequency over their baseline prevalence, but not one motif crosses that threshold for “terror.” If we examine the top of the “terror” list anyway, the tag shows an anemic increase in fainting (19% more than baseline), suicide mentions (18%), female fainting (18%), and secret doors (18%) compared to the overall corpus, but all of these mostifs appear more in “horror” works than they do in “terror.” Fainting, suicide, and secret doors might allow us to spot terror or horror Gothics against a background of sentimental Gothics or other modes, but they are not useful in defining a terror/horror divide. We can more directly seek that distinction by comparing “terror” only to “horror,” but from this view too, however, there are fewer motifs, with weaker correlations. Whereas there were three motifs which appeared four or five times more often in horror works than terror works, there are no motifs which distinguish terror that strongly. One motif does appear with triple frequency in terror works compared to horror: “speech, unfinished, on deathbed.”  Appearing a little more than twice as often are “good abbess”, and “good clergyman,” and a little less than twice are “attempted or contemplated suicide” and “lunacy.” None of these motifs drew our attention when we examined Tracy alone, because they are not strongly gendered. It is potentailly fruitful to see them distinguished now, and consider them as potential markers of a terror Gothic as distinct from a women’s Gothic.

            <Title>the female Gothic</Title>
            <Text>Their confined experience also appeared to allow women unique access to psychological depth. This psychological approach particularly flourished in the subgenre of the female Gothic, which emphasized the uncertainties of perception that heroines suffer in an obscure, dangerous, patriarchal world. Ann Radcliffe’s Gothic novels exemplify the genre by portraying heroines fleeing male violence or confined by tyrants, and entangled in murky plots featuring nefarious outlaws, madness, and murder. The suspense arises less from the dramatic action than from the technique of representing the scenes entirely through the protagonist’s consciousness.  … Radcliffe’s plot unravels through the fears, confusions, and superstitions of her heroine, so that readers can never clearly see where the truth lies.  (“Male” and “Female” Novels?)
Nonetheless, ‘male’ and ‘female’ novels of the period share themes and plot lines. Foremost are the themes of the discovery of identity and recovery of inheritance. (“Male” and “Female” Novels?)
Gothic novels took two distinct forms depending on whether, structurally speaking, the protagonist is an exemplary woman (or man) or a morally reprehensible villain. The ‘female Gothic’ is a serious action—like Pamela—a melodrama arousing sympathy and suspense through the unwarranted persecution of an innocent. The ‘male Gothic’ is a punitive tragedy—like Richard III or Macbeth—in which we are made both to desire and to expect the condign punishment of the central figure. The first subgenre includes The Mysteries of Udolpho and The Italian, and countless imitators. The second includes the main plot of The Monk, sections of Melmoth the Wanderer, and Confessions of a Justified Sinner. These may exist in relatively pure form, but some Gothic novels, including The Castle of Otranto, have incorporated both plots into a mixed form whose focus shifts in different parts of the narrative. (The Gothic Novel and the Lingering Appeal of Romance)
	•	The most successful Gothic villains, the Montonis and Schedonis, are dark fathers, images of the demon lover or the destroying angel. Within the plot structure of the romance, these figures are frequently the heroine’s uncle—a displacement from literal fatherhood that underlines the incestuous basis of the fear and love they exact while making more probable the heroine’s terrors of violation or murder. 
	•	In Gothic romances like The Monk and Melmoth the Wanderer, written by and largely for men, the Oedipal agon often takes the appropriately opposite form, with the male victim in thrall to a maternal woman. 
To conclude, there were in the 1790s two very different implied readers: the first, whom clergymen and journalists of the age personified as older and male, read primarily for factual information, for the reinforcement of ethical values, and for the pleasure of recognizing the persons and things of his world; the second was personified as younger and female, receptive rather than critical, and eager to indulge in the pleasures of the imagination. And the Gothic vogue was partly self-reinforcing, in that its popularity began to draw in new classes of reader who had not formerly been a significant part of the market for literature. One major result was to pave the way for the reception of Romanticism in poetry as well as fiction, with the result that English bards—Wordsworth, Byron, and Scott, at least—despite a bit of rough handling from Scottish reviewers, were able to stir without conspicuous resistance a public that already looked to literature for the play of fantasy, dream, and desire. The second result was in the Gothic itself, which after 1810 tended to abandon the historical themes of Radcliffe for the more explicitly fantastic imaginative worlds of Mary Shelley and Charles Robert Maturin. By then the Gothic wave itself had already begun to recede, leaving in its ebb two masterpieces, Frankenstein (1818) and Melmoth the Wanderer (1820). While the Gothic was to rise again, first with the Brontës, and later, at the end of the nineteenth century, with the supernatural tales of Stevenson, James, Wilde, and Stoker, the romance of Radcliffe was at an end, destroyed, ironically, by that arch-romantic poet, Walter Scott. … The popularity of Scott and historical romances like his was immense, because in effect Scott had, by his use of realistic detail, licensed male readers to enjoy the romance, which otherwise they had despised—or pretended to despise—as feminine aesthetic experience.  (The Gothic Novel and the Lingering Appeal of Romance)
The ‘man of feeling’ is one who has‘sense’ (that is to say, ‘nerve’), but whose capacity for moral action is inhibited ordisabled in some way. / The woman of sensibility … may represent either of two senses of the word ‘sensibility’: first, the ethical humanism of Sophia, who embodies the restraint, judgement, and sympathy that Hutcheson, Hume, and Smith distinguished as moral sentiments; and second, the excessively nervous sensibility of Harriot, a creature consumed by self-interest.

            <Title>why gothic = sentimental matters</Title>
            <Text>The focus on the settings, theatrical machinery, etc of the Gothic tries to make the story distant from readers— but it was manifestly NOT distant; it was emotionally immediate, just like sentimental novels and novels of sensibility etc
The emotional wildness doesn’t happen in a safely contained and remote fictive realm of irrationality: it’s not a removed place in which to ‘work out’ rebellion against repression — it is a space in which the reader exists as an embodied and connected participant.

            <Text>Frank’s women’s Gothic challenges few stereotypes of women’s writing. Like Tracy, he indexes slightly more female authors than male. Three of the most popular tags are even more female-dominated than his woman-heavy sample would lead us to expect: 43% of Frank’s corpus is written by women, but that 43% is responsible for 50% of the “terror” works, 65% of the “Radcliffean” works, and a striking 77% of the “sentimental.” Contemporary criticism has worked to revise the eighteenth-century consensus that the literary sphere was overtaken with a flood of dangerous sentimental literature by and for women: Barbara Benedict, for example, ruthlessly debunks a range of “manifestly untrue” eighteenth-century perceptions of reading demographics, and many others have agreed that most readers and most writers were men, and even that men and women mostly read the same things. However, the preponderance of women writing Frank’s sentimental works suggests a kernel of truth underlying eighteenth-century critics’ panic. It is entirely possible for readers to be mostly male, and authors mostly male, even within the sphere of specifically Gothic publishing, but for female authors to nonetheless write a detectably feminine kind of book. Frank presents us with a Radcliffean, sentimental, terror Gothic which is also a women’s Gothic. This women’s Gothic is exactly the sort subgenre which would be invisible in Tracy’s model, because it doesn’t operate by identifiable motif. If we turn away from a serch for privileged subject matter which only women will think to describe — not subterranean passages or blood — and instead observe the less-quantifiable intangibles that Frank uses — tone, attitude, aesthetics — then we can find a broadly popular women’s Gothic.</Text>
            <Comments>His corpus is 43% female, 31% male, 26% unknown. Tracy’s is 50% female,  45% male, 5% unknown.

            <Title>sentimental / Gothic</Title>
            <Text>Whereas the sentimental novels of the 1770s used epistolary narrators to relate stories of love and feeling from the perspective of both men and women, by the 1790s the new, Gothic novels were centred on women besieged by tyranny from without and uncertainty from within. (“Male” and “Female” novels)
An empathic mindset tightly focused upon a heroine’s fears was nothing new: it had been demanded of readers by Pamela and by the sentimental novel, out of which the female Gothic developed. And yet if differences in quantity eventually make for differences in quality, the Gothic novel may have had such an impact on a major segment of the British reading public. That there was something like an addiction among the Gothic readers is suggested, not only by cautionary letters to women’s magazines but by (p. 485) the receipts from circulating libraries, which show one celebrated bluestocking going through fifty-five volumes of romance in the space of a month. (The Gothic Novel and the Lingering Appeal of Romance)
Developments in Sentimental Fiction
	⁃	Sentimentalism may be defined many ways, but Burns’s letter highlights one of them: the longing after an imagined world, sometimes but not necessarily utopian or feminocentric, in which sympathy, benevolence, and goodness are the predominant virtues. 
	⁃	Though the sentimentalist may profess a belief in Providence, he or she always has faith in the power of an internal monitor, whether it be ‘feeling’ or ‘the heart’ or an (p. 427) innate or acquired ‘sensibility’, to regulate the passions and conduct. Realism, on the other hand, is often distinguished by the recognition that sensibility is an unreliable, ‘irregular’ power that may need to be assisted by external law, code, or custom. 
	⁃	It is difficult to fix a date by which sentimentalism became a dominant element in the English novel; in some ways, it has always been part of the genre
	⁃	 several characters and structural elements that are typical of sentimental fiction:
	⁃	First, we note the female protagonist: ‘ “Virtue in distress” ’, says G. J. Barker-Benfield, borrowing a phrase enshrined in critical literature by R. F. Brissenden, ‘was archetypally female.’
	⁃	the disapproval of a corrupted or incompetent parent, the predations of a rich and powerful male, the temptations of a comfortable settlement according to the ways of the world
	⁃	The testing of virtue is usually conducted in a domestic space
	⁃	The reward of passing such a test is generally marriage, not as an act of submission to a ‘psychosexual and social-moral inevitability’ but as ‘a creative and self-expansive act’
	⁃	The suffering of the heroine deepens her sensibility, not to her own pain but to the predicament of another
	⁃	The ‘man of feeling’ is one who has‘sense’ (that is to say, ‘nerve’), but whose capacity for moral action is inhibited ordisabled in some way
	⁃	The woman of sensibility … may represent either of two senses of the word ‘sensibility’: first, the ethical humanism of Sophia, who embodies the restraint, judgement, and sympathy that Hutcheson, Hume, and Smith distinguished as moral sentiments; and second, the excessively nervous sensibility of Harriot, a creature consumed by self-interest
	⁃	There are complex historical reasons for the decline of sentimental fiction after the 1790s. Margaret Cohen, writing about the history of the novel in France, suggests that the ‘hostile takeover’ of the genre by such realists as Balzac and Stendhal can be attributed to the need to impose order on the ‘chaos’ of literary and social relations in the early decades of the nineteenth century, a thesis that might also be applied to the English novel.36 Elizabeth Dolan finds in the works of Charlotte Smith, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Mary Shelley a shift towards ‘seeing suffering unsentimentally’, a focus on poverty, slavery, and gender oppression not merely to evoke sympathy, but to effect social change and relieve distress.37 Stephen Ahern suggests that the excesses of amatory, sentimental, and Gothic fiction that gave these novels their affective power also created ‘anxiety’ among readers and an ‘ambivalence’ among ‘authors writing fiction in the romance mode’ which eventually led to the ‘domestication’ of the form.38 The way forward for studies in sentimental fiction, however, may be not in uncovering the reasons for its decline, but in discovering the ways in which the forms of sentiment have survived, and continue to have an impact on the writing of fiction.
The myth informing many or most popular/modern novels was the identity-mystery romance, extending from Tom Jones to Fatherless Fanny to Oliver Twist and beyond. This took diverse forms but its core was a plot of exile, recognition, and return.
This myth had many variations from Tom Jones to Fatherless Fanny, including self- misrecognition from Lennox and Graves to Austen and Scott, social misrecognition in sentimental and Gothic novels from Walpole and Reeve to Smith and Radcliffe, moral and social misrecognition in Burney and Austen, social-political persecution in Godwin’s Caleb Williams and Wollstonecraft’s Wrongs of Woman, misrepresentation in Newgate and ‘Silver Fork’ novels of the 1820s and 1830s, and so on. Whatever the variant, whether found in owned or rented novels, in sixpenny-chapbook or full-length format, this myth had to be reread, repeatedly re-engaged, hence making certain novels ‘popular’, because the conditions the myth addressed continued central to novel readers’ real material interests. It was not the only myth readable into the popular novels of these decades, but it was comprehensive, central, powerful, and adaptable and may well, as contemporary commentators like Barbauld suggested, have helped its readers imagine, desire, pursue, and assume what they saw as their ‘rightful’ place in the emergent modern state. (The Popular Novel)
And then one starts to notice odd comic traces in more didactic and sentimental novels. (Novels of the 1750s)
 Revamping the Enlightenment tradition of the conte philosophique, these supporters of the Revolution in France and political reform in Britain advocated a newly ambitious species of novel capable of building bridges between the discursive domains of fiction and political theory. These novelists also set out to claim the power over readers’ emotions they found in sentimental fiction’s stories of suffering individuals. At the same time, contrariwise, they aimed to assemble comprehensive accounts of the social system—of ‘things as they are’, in Godwin’s phrase—and touted their commitment to the promulgation of universal, impersonal truth.

            <Text>The consensus then and since, that most circulating libraries stocked novels that were formula escapist ‘trash’ largely by women and for women and servants, is being modified by new quantitative and qualitative research. … Though women outnumbered its men authors there were many of the latter, there were about as many novels with male as female protagonists, and many novels show sophisticated awareness of gender stereotypes. (“The Popular Novel, 1790-1820) 
“The eighteenth (p. 428) century did see an enlarging role for women as readers and writers of fiction, but gender alone cannot account for the change of direction: works by male authors, such as Goldsmith’s The Vicar of Wakefield, Sterne’s A Sentimental Journey, Mackenzie’s The Man of Feeling, and Smollett’s The Expedition of Humphry Clinker were popular with readers of both sexes.” (“Developments in Sentimental Fiction”)

“Yet the arguments that, first, only women read novels at all, and yet, secondly, that only bad women read novels whereas good women read good works—particularly sermons and conduct manuals—were manifestly untrue. … By the late eighteenth century, however, more women than ever before were writing novels, and recent research has shown that they produced about a third of those published.9 From 1770 to 1800, novels identified as female on their title pages crested, but so, indeed, did all novels… In fact, most novel-readers were male, as most readers always had been. By the mid-eighteenth century, only about 60 per cent of men and 40 per cent of women could read at all, and, while works of religion, history, geography, and travel outstripped novels in most libraries, provincial novel-readers and library-borrowers were primarily male.24 In fact, men and women read largely the same books” (‘Male’ and ‘Female’ novels?)</Text>

            <Text>This women’s Gothic does also appear to be a “school of Radcliffe”. [Because of] Frank’s interest in the sources of various works, his “Gothic types” mention specific authors by name for nearly a quarter of the works in his bibliography. Of those 114 works, 58 have Radcliffe as their precedent, [making her the “mother” for] just over half the works with a named source. After Radcliffe comes Lewis, with 13 imitators, then Walpole (12), Clara Reeve (6), and Charlotte Smith (5).

            <Title>women's gothic, not female gothic</Title>
            <Text>By turning to the late eighteenth-century Gothic, and particularly the troublesome category of “the female Gothic”, I examine a mass of books that have been vaguely disreputable since they were first published. At its inception and for most of its literary history, criticism of Gothic emotional excess or implausible machinery generally went hand-in-hand with dismissals of the genre as unserious due to its perceived alignment with women. In the 1980s, feminist critics like Juliann Fleenor enabled the “Female Gothic”, defined as Gothic works “written and consistently read by women”, to stand as a worthy object of study regardless of the individual works’ literary qualities due to their direct relationships to a patriarchal paradigm and their ability “to express the conflict for which patriarchy has no name”. Contemporary critics have turned their attention from relationships between women and their world to relationships between texts. This shift is exemplified in Robert Miles’s sophisticated reading of Ann Radcliffe and Matthew Lewis’s works as making use of both “Female Gothic” and “Male Gothic” “narrative grammar”. Any number of definitions for male and female Gothics are available. [Robert Miles’ definition of male/female gothics here.] David Richter provides definitions based on plot structures: “The ‘female Gothic’ is … a melodrama arousing sympathy and suspense through the unwarranted persecution of an innocent. The ‘male Gothic’ is a punitive tragedy…in which we are made both to desire and to expect the condign punishment of the central figure.” Even Barbara Benedict’s “‘Male’ and ‘Female’ Novels?”, which questions the premise of gender division in its title, refers with assurance to “the subgenre of the female Gothic, which emphasized the uncertainties of perception that heroines suffer in an obscure, dangerous, patriarchal world”. My interest is in something less fine-grained: not the exemplary literary aesthetic of a Female Gothic, but the popular phenomenon of a women’s Gothic. Over the course of three literary experiments, in which I model the early Gothic novel by means of bibliographic data, I ask whether the hundreds of women writing Gothic novels wrote observably different books than the hundreds of men doing the same. In doing so, I find that men’s and women’s schools do indeed exist, but that they do not map neatly to a set of female/male terror/horror Radcliffe/Lewis binaries, and that both gendered schools are dwarfed by a non-gendered Gothic mainstream. </Text>

Thank you so much for re-sending it! I think now that I did actually get it, and read it on my phone while half-asleep, and thought to myself, "aaaah this raises a compelling and thorny issue that I will have to think hard to resolve" and then, I guess, archived the email and fell asleep again and forgot about it.
But, it is extremely helpful, and I so much appreciate all the time and thought you put into it! You really cut straight to the heart of the thing that was causing all my writerly distress, I think

oulfis
that, essentially, I have one paper about  these motifs, and another paper about the gothic as sentimental literature, and do not have a sufficient bridge between them.
I think in the end I will want to handwave, since "the real, hard proof of the Gothic's sentimental geneaology" is one of the subjects of my dissertation, and the motifs research was, essentially, how I got interested in the sentimental gothic
but that suggests to me that I need to set aside more of these sentimental thoughts until I know what it is that I actually know, there, and for *this* motif paper stick to just the things which can be adequately supported by these two bibliographers.

havingbeenbreathedout
oh good, I'm so glad it was helpful! and re: your reconstructed theory about reading &amp; archiving, I'm torn between commiseration and laughter, since I very much relate. I'm just sorry I didn't follow up sooner &amp; make sure you'd received it, since it's now been quite a while! but hopefully you can now move forward in a productive way. *cheers you on*

oulfis
Follow-up was definitely not on you! I'm still feeling very aversive to this project (especially, it seems, while essentially asleep) so I have been procrastinating.. but I got another burst of breaking-down-my-fears by mentioning my block to my advisor, who helpfully said, "this is exactly the sort of thing it's your advisor's job to help you with, you don't have to magically write the perfect draft alone" and agreed to look whenever I have it all a bit more polished. And she is much less scary than the prof I was trying to make myself send it to, so I think after my special fields I'll be able to get something to her.
she also agreed that the first journal article is the hardest, and that I will get the hang of it -- which was heartening, too.

havingbeenbreathedout
gosh, that's great!! and as it should be! it is so difficult to keep in mind that this is supposed to be one of the points of the mentor/mentee or advisor/advisee relationship. I HATE to show anything to anyone before it's absolutely as polished as I can get it—and that includes Gins! But that is not a productive approach and I'm glad your advisor is challenging it with heartening results. :-)

oulfis
I definitely sought out a different advisor/advisee relationship at U of T than I've had in the past -- undergrad and MA I was intimidated by the brilliance of my thesis advisors, and always terrified that they thought I was dull -- and it is indeed nice to be benefitting from that increased space for vulnerability

            <Title>mainstream Gothic</Title>
            <Text>Frank’s Gothic mainstream is largely non-gendered. The two most prevalent tags in the corpus as a whole, representing all Gothics without attention paid to authorial gender, are “Gothic” (83% of all works) and “pure/high” (39%), both of which have the same gendered distribution of the sample as a whole. Our only hint of a gendered trend among the most widespread tags is the third most prevalent tag, “terror” (34% of works), which, at 50% female, is somewhat above the female baseline of 43%. The next two tags in prominence are not informative about genre variation, but instead highlight the multiplicity of Frank’s assessments: the tags “mode” and “elements” are each applied to 27% of all works in the sample. These terms generally appear as qualifiers for his other assessments, as in “terror mode” or “sentimental elements,” and accordingly remind us to modify the implied force of “terror” and “sentimental” as tags. Indeed, many of Frank’s tags are essentially qualifiers: “mode”, “effects”, “Gothified”, and “imitation,” for example. In Frank’s Gothic typology, then, the Gothic is not monolithic: each work assembles multiple elements, which have their sources elsewhere, and are all interconnected. Nothing for Frank is just one genre. Even horror and terror are far from mutually exclusive. Of the 53 “horror” works, 26 (49%) are also tagged “terror”. These 26 are 50% by men, making the horror-terror mode more predictive of male authorship than horror alone. Of the remaining 27 works which are purely horror, no terror, there are 9 by women, 9 by men, and 9 unknown — a far cry from the horror Gothic as the exclusive province of men. This is the reverse of Tracy — Tracy showed a male horror and equal-opportunity terror mainstream; Frank shows equal-opportunity horror, and female terror. Between the two, the only part that’s consistent is that terror vastly outnumbers horror. There are gendered currents, but none of them are striking enough to start making predictions about the many unsigned works.</Text>

            <Title>theory: my bibs have thin description</Title>
            <Text>My theoretical approach emphasizes the continuities between computational approaches to literature and the the venerable tradition of archival bibliographical research. Heather Love has notably turned to sociological microanalysis as a model for 'thin description' close-but-not-deep reading methods; I employ qualitative computational modelling as another method which seeks the same goals. Love emphasizes thin description as not just “fine-grained” but “exhaustive” (and possibly exhausting) but with the reward that “one could—at least ideally—pay equal attention to every aspect … and record it faithfully.”  I add to this that good descriptions offer themselves up for reuse and recombination, by rendering somehow graspable that which they describe. Downplaying the importance of close interpretation, Love says that “Good descriptions … account for the real variety that is already there.” It is the work of accounting for real variety that both bibliography and computation demand: the system must have a way to cope with odd cases. Even if one simply makes an exception to otherwise-established rules, or adds an expanatory footnote or a comment within one’s code, outliers must be acknowledged and grappled with. I use computational interventions to interrogate the literary models represented in two older bibliographies. In so doing, I argue, I demonstrate the utility of qualitative description, as a promising avenue toward revisiting older scholarships and re-forging connections with the work that has come before.</Text>

“This book examines the links between sentimentalism and narrative self-reflexivity in eighteenth-century novels about men of feeling.”


Notes From: ALEX WETMORE. “MEN OF FEELING IN EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY LITERATURE.” iBooks.  

“The pervasive self-consciousness of these texts, when it is addressed at all,1 has sometimes been seen as evidence of eighteenth-century literature’s capacity to anticipate (post)modernist experiments in metafiction, or as an indication of underlying tensions between the form and content of sentimental fiction. In this book, however, I argue that instances of narrative self-reflexivity in novels about men of feeling can best be accounted for as strategies of ‘corporeal defamiliarization.”


Notes From: ALEX WETMORE. “MEN OF FEELING IN EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY LITERATURE.” iBooks. 

May 8, 2017 

“novels about men of feeling exhibit a distinct type of self-consciousness that is more concerned with denaturalizing their own status as tactile, tangible books – and with the entanglements of the literary and the somatic more broadly – than with representing themselves as constructions of language or structural convention”


Notes From: ALEX WETMORE. “MEN OF FEELING IN EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY LITERATURE.” iBooks.

“support sentimentalism’s preoccupation with embodied sensibility through strategies of corporeal defamiliarization that foreground books as intimate things to be felt, whose literary value should be approached along physiological lines”


Notes From: ALEX WETMORE. “MEN OF FEELING IN EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY LITERATURE.” iBooks. 
May 9, 2017 

“One of the benefits of approaching self-reflexivity as corporeal defamiliarization is that it brings formal properties that can appear antagonistic to sentimental fiction into alignment with one of the genre’s most characteristic features: its valorization of the sensitive body as a medium for communicating sympathy and virtue”

“In response to the rise of a modern commercial public sphere in Britain, some authors attempted to articulate new justifications for the traditional ideal of public virtue, some articulated more private models of virtue like economic frugality or domestic femininity, while many others resigned themselves to exposing and satirizing the inevitable corruption of the age.”

“Burke’s statement is reminiscent of novelistic depictions of men of feeling not only in its open confession of male sensibility, but also in the fact that the confession manifests itself in a self-referential literary gesture.

“One of Burke’s harshest critics is Mary Wollstonecraft, who criticizes Burke’s appeals to sensibility not as a sign of his “superior humanity” but of his manipulativeness, foppishness and effeminacy.

            <Text>Having declared an interest in eighteenth century novels and bibliographic research, Peter Garside and James Raven’s monumental The English Novel, 1770–1829 immediately demands consideration. Lee Erickson aptly called it “magnificent” for its scope. But is is Garside’s scope which works against this project; instead, I will use two earlier bibliographies, by Ann Tracy and Frederick Frank, which are more partial, qualitative, and idiosyncratic — features which may not recommend a bibliography as a general reference, but which make them rich subjects for modelling. Both works’ basic bibliographical data is duplicated in Garside, but both also offer substantial qualitative descriptions of the works they list, including summaries of their contents. Ann Tracy indexes 208 works from the years 1753-1857, of which 103 are by female authors, 95 by male, and only 10 unknown. Frederick Frank indexes 499 works published in the years 1753 to 1835 (with one outlier by Beckford not published until 1912). 215 of Frank’s authors are female, 156 male, and 128 unknown. Because each bibliographer excludes some works which are included by the other, they provide information about 529 unique texts, but only 178 works are indexed in both bibliographies.  Both show substantially higher counts of female authorship, and lower counts of anonymous authorship, than were typical of novels as a whole. This over-representation of women might be selection bias, or it might reflect some underlying reality to the period’s assumption that women wrote Gothics; this paper won’t answer that question, but will instead statistically normalize raw book counts.</Text>

Indeed, each works’ basic bibliographical data is improved in the Garside— one of my early steps was to check both Frank and Tracy against Garside, which allowed me to correct some errors in publication dates and titles, and revealed a handful of new authorship attributions for unsigned works. Except for the authorship attributions, these differences have no impact on my experiments, but all discrepancies between Frank or Tracy and Garside have been silently amended in favour of Garside.
Although she includes a few works that are chronological outliers, Tracy’s emphasis is firmly on the years indicated on her title, 1790-1830

            <Text>I touch on the implications that these finding might have for the way we understand Ann Radcliffe’s works, but my primary interest is in the ‘school of Radcliffe’ itself. This ‘school’ was, evidently, readily identifieable to Radcliffe’s contemporaries, but I argue that its identifying features are not entirely those which seem most notable to modern critics. [I see a historically-defined, socially-shaped ‘school of Radcliffe’ which involves primarily female authors, and distinguish this from the critical construction of a ‘Female Gothic’.]</Text>

            <Title>reverse outline</Title>
            <Text>This paper emphasizes the continuities between computational approaches to literature and the venerable tradition of archival bibliographical research. Everybody takes the generic categories of “male” and “female” Gothic for granted, though we quibble over what makes up each one. My interest is in something less fine-grained: not the exempary literary aesthetic of the Female Gothic, but the popular social phrenomenon of a women’s Gothic. I use two qualitative bibliographies of the Gothic. My method consists of trying out different “models” and seeing which ones are fruitful. Not all models are computational, as Leah Price’s work on editing and the mental editing of reading proves. Each of my bibliographies is itself a model, which I amplify through my computational methods. I find that men’s and women’s schools do indeed exist, but that they do not map neatly to a set of female/male terror/horror Radcliffe/Lewis binaries, and that both gendered schools are dwarfed by a non-gendered Gothic mainstream. As a model of the Gothic, Tracy’s bibliography elides continuities to increase its sensitivity to points of difference. It treats each novel as a collection of discrete elements, only one of which is likely to be of interest to a given scholar. I examine the potential predictive power of each motif. An identifiable gendered school immediately emerges: 38 distinctly male-authored motifs indicate a men’s Gothic defined by largely the things we would expect men to dominate. In contrast to this abundance of male-dominated tropes, female-authored tropes are elusive. More than half of the motifs under consideration are not strongly gendered in either direction. This motif-based model of the early Gothic suggests that, rather than a balanced oppositions of Radcliffe’s female terror Gothic versus Lewis’s male horror Gothic, the genre as a popular movement was defined by a less-sensationalist (possibly Radcliffean, possibly terror-mode) non-genered Gothic mainstream, with a subset of male horror Gothic writers making up a minor tradition within it. Although it attempts to model the same field, Frederick Frank’s bibliography encourages a very different understanding of the texts he indexes. Unlike Tracy, Frank is interested in not just what happens, but in how it happens. I have separated out each strand of influence within his complex “Gothic types”  by dividing each “type” into a set of tags, and tallied the uses of each tag. Frank’s model of the multiplicity of Gothic subgenres, in the reverse of Tracy, shows an identifiable women’s Gothic, whereas the men’s Gothic is elusive. Frank presents us with a Radcliffean, sentimental, terror Gothic which is also a women’s Gothic. This [women’s Gothic] is exactly he sort of [genre/trend] which would be invisible in Tracy’s model, because it doesn’t operate by identifiable motif. A men’s Gothic is more elusive in Frank’s model. In Frank’s Gothic typology, the Gothic is not monolithic: [works use elements of things, but things mostly come from other places/ are interconnected] Does knowing Frank gave a work a certain tag tell us anything about what motifs it probably has? For both “terror” and “horror”, we can examine the motifs which distinguish it from the baseline mainstream Gothic, and which motifs distinguish it from the other tag. There are some horror motifs, and they seem reasonable.  [All of these motifs paint a distinct horror tradition, which our earlier models also allow us to see as male.]  [But it complicates our understanding of “horror” by introducing motifs which previously were not male-dominated enough to get mentally put in that bucket.] The “terror” tag, as expected, is less strongly defined by its motifs. None of these motifs drew our attention when we examined Tracy alone, because they are not strongly gendered. [It is interesting to see them distinguished now, and consider them as potential markers of a terror Gothic as distinct from a women’s Gothic.] [But they simply reaffirm that terror is mainstream / isn’t gendered] [This correlation, essentially, confirms that our rough guess was right re: Tracy’s motifs, that the men’s Gothic might operate via striking images but the women’s Gothic less so.] [It also suggests that, when we are seduced by the scenery of the Gothic, we end up paying attention to only a minor thread within it (men’s horror) at the expense of non-motif-ifiable features which better define the mainstream.]</Text>
            <Comments>I interpret a motif to be “distinctly male” if 60% or more of its authors are male.</Comments>

            <Title>Wetmore thoughts</Title>
            <Text>Wetmore argues that the “crisis of sensibility” of the 1790s “led…more to dispersions and disavowals than to an actual eradication of the practice” (CITE); I suggest that these dispersions include a relocation to the Gothic and form part of its marginalization
Wetmore argues that the “valorization of sensibility…helped justify women’s increasing presence in and influence upon the… public sphere” (CITE), through the “commonly-held view that women writers dominated the fiction market by propagating publicly-beneficial sentimental values” (CITE). My data suggests that women may, indeed, have been notably more sentimental in their writing than men by this time.
Wetmore has a lot to say about the new suspicions that arose around sentimentality, gender play, etc, but I am not so interested in the reception of these ideas as I am in their presence; if Frank shows a lot of sentimentality (need to double check if this is true??) then that might suggest an explanation for the marginal status of the Gothic, through its association with the marginalizaed sentimental…. All of the things that the sentimental novel is disparaged for, the Gothic is doubly disparaged for.
	•	“this period was more notable for its investment in forms of identity play that would later be resisted and considered transgressive after the Romantic turn.”
	•	“Increasingly, however, as the century wore on, a sense of the culture of sensibility’s radical potential to promote equality transformed into growing anxieties over its limitations.”
	•	Gender play —&gt; gender panic
	•	sentimentalism’s preoccupation with embodied sensibility through strategies of corporeal defamiliarization that foreground books as intimate things to be felt, whose literary value should be approached along physiological lines”
	•	“One of the benefits of approaching self-reflexivity as corporeal defamiliarization is that it brings formal properties that can appear antagonistic to sentimental fiction into alignment with one of the genre’s most characteristic features: its valorization of the sensitive body as a medium for communicating sympathy and virtue”
	•	“somatic scepticism is a central feature not only of these particular works, but of the eighteenth century’s culture of sensibility more broadly”

Wetmore’s main focus (which I should therefore address) is on the role of the book:
“novels about men of feeling exhibit a distinct type of self-consciousness that is more concerned with denaturalizing their own status as tactile, tangible books – and with the entanglements of the literary and the somatic more broadly – than with representing themselves as constructions of language or structural convention” “foreground books as intimate things to be felt, whose literary value should be approached along physiological lines”
This too is essentially how the Gothic operates / how we tend to evaluate the Gothic.
(Though… why is the Gothic found so wanting, by this value system? …This is no longer the value system by the time that the Gothic appears? The Gothic becomes particularly notable and shocking once this value system loses its currency, since the Gothic operates so strongly upon these ideas?)
Wetmore’s work influences my conclusions by highlighting the goals, techniques, and judgments of the sentimental, all of which I argue are relevant to a heightened extent for the Gothic. He thus provides support for my suggestion that we seek a geneaology of the Gothic based in the French sentimental novel.</Text>

            <Title>I'm modelling here</Title>
            <Text>Although I will use a number of graphs to make my argument, the key term for my methodological approach is not “data visualization,” but “modelling.” Johanna Drucker has given compelling warnings about the dangers of treating constructed information as empirically objective “data” which may then be passively “visualized”. Willard McCarty’s discussion of models as both “pragmatic” and “fictive” is more accurate to the scholarly process of gathering, classifying, correlating, and interpreting information. Whether a model is a reading or a bar chart, the worth of that model must be judged by its “fruitfulness”, a term for which Stephen Ramsay provides a useful definition:  “the robustness of the discussion that a particular procedure annunciates”. In other words, whether or not the model has revealed what we expected to see, it has revealed something with which we must now engage. Exact corerspondence is thus less of a “fundamental principle”, and more of an imagined destination which spurs valuable journeys. This flexibility allows us to cope with the fact that as a model is constructed, it becomes sensitive to some areas of difference while eliding others. No model needs to be accurate in all points, so long as it is sensitive to the desired area of differences. It is also worth noting that not all models are computational, as is evidenced by the meticulous historical research of Leah Price, whose monograph The Anthology and the Rise of the Novel argues that any edited text — ‘elaborate’ or not — produces, not a flawed or distorted copy of the original, but a new text. As Price observes, when scholars examine texts — when we take notes on them, extract quotes for close reading, summarize of categorize scenes, chapters of books — our act of reading is also one of editing. McCarty allows us to recognize that this mental editing is not a sign of scholarly weakness, but a model, made necessary by the limits of human memory.</Text>

            <Title>women's gothic, not female gothic</Title>
            <Text>By turning to the late eighteenth-century Gothic, and particularly the troublesome category of “the female Gothic”, I examine a mass of books that have been vaguely disreputable since they were first published. At its inception and for most of its literary history, criticism of Gothic emotional excess or implausible machinery generally went hand-in-hand with dismissals of the genre as unserious due to its perceived alignment with women. In the 1980s, feminist critics like Juliann Fleenor enabled the “Female Gothic”, defined as Gothic works “written and consistently read by women”, to stand as a worthy object of study regardless of the individual works’ literary qualities due to their direct relationships to a patriarchal paradigm and their ability “to express the conflict for which patriarchy has no name”. Contemporary critics have turned their attention from relationships between women and their world to relationships between texts. This shift is exemplified in Robert Miles’s sophisticated reading of Ann Radcliffe and Matthew Lewis’s works as making use of both “Female Gothic” and “Male Gothic” “narrative grammar”. Any number of definitions for male and female Gothics are available. [Robert Miles’ definition of male/female gothics here.] David Richter provides definitions based on plot structures: “The ‘female Gothic’ is … a melodrama arousing sympathy and suspense through the unwarranted persecution of an innocent. The ‘male Gothic’ is a punitive tragedy…in which we are made both to desire and to expect the condign punishment of the central figure.” Even Barbara Benedict’s “‘Male’ and ‘Female’ Novels?”, which questions the premise of gender division in its title, refers with assurance to “the subgenre of the female Gothic, which emphasized the uncertainties of perception that heroines suffer in an obscure, dangerous, patriarchal world”. My interest is in something less fine-grained: not the exemplary literary aesthetic of a Female Gothic, but the popular phenomenon of a women’s Gothic. Over the course of three literary experiments, in which I model the early Gothic novel by means of bibliographic data, I ask whether the hundreds of women writing Gothic novels wrote observably different books than the hundreds of men doing the same. In doing so, I find that men’s and women’s schools do indeed exist, but that they do not map neatly to a set of female/male terror/horror Radcliffe/Lewis binaries, and that both gendered schools are dwarfed by a non-gendered Gothic mainstream. </Text>

            <Title>Frank and Tracy are models</Title>
            <Text>My two ‘texts’ — bibliographies by Ann Tracy and Frederick Frank — are thus themselves models of “The Gothic Novel.” Because, as Price observes, the process of editing a text must always reveal the editor’s “unspoken assumptions about the most efficient way to convey information, and indeed what counts as information at all,” the editorial processes behind each bibliography makes each one sensitive to very different concerns. Ann Tracy’s The Gothic Novel 1790-1830: Plot Summaries and Index to Motifs emphazises dramatic events and singular images, with recurring details systematically tallied in the index. In contrast, Frederick Frank’s The First Gothics: A Critical Guide to the English Gothic Novel emphasizes each work’s overall tone and provides qualitative and subtle evaluations of its critical reception. Although only 178 works are shared between the two, they usefully complement each other in the search for gendered Gothic writing traditions. The process of computationally re-rendering each bibliography amplifies each bibliographer’s choices, allowing me to see whether their distinctions are fruitful, and whether their models point toward distinct men’s and women’s Gothics.</Text>
            <Comments>cite Price 13
The Garside bibliography, too, is a model, with its own particular concerns. It emphasizes “the full title given to the work, the imprint of the original publisher(s), and unmediated information as to how authorship was first signified,” reflecting an interest in “the ways in which novels were first projected at their readers” (“‘Ordering’ Novels: Describing Prose Fiction, 1770-1832” p. 388), and so the notes include information about dedicatees, issue variations, subscription lists, included advertisements, subsequent editions, translations, and attributions. The key editorial intervention is the inclusion of contemporary reviews. Together, these details build a model of a public sphere of letters, in which the Gothic is just one of many markets.</Comments>

            <Title>Tracy values uniqueness</Title>
            <Text>Tracy’s bibliography is built to be more like a particularly helpful finding aid than a comprehensive check-list.  Her most unusual qualitative bibliographical work is her ten-page “Index to Motifs” identifying the books in which 208 different “motifs” appear. Tracy uses the term “motif” broadly to encompass a wide range of plot elements, images, and character types. The index is intended for “scholars with particular interests”, who wish to locate and read books containing individual story elements, such as “doppelganger” or “garden as scene of temptation”. Accordingly, Tracy prioritizes presenting a wide range of highly distinctive motifs rather than those that constitute the norm. Indeed, she intentionally excluded the most popular motifs: “the abundance of murders,” she says, “argued for the retention… of specialized murders only,” and castles have similarly been ingored. In addition to the motifs, Tracy provides a plot summary of each novel. Her summaries, too, emphasize distinctive details, pointing out things like “a particularly interesting Satan, with molten insides”. As a model of the Gothic, Tracy’s bibliography elides continuities to increase its sensitivity to points of difference. It treats each novel as a collection of discrete elements, only one of which is likely to be of interest to a given scholar. The motifs themselves — Satans, murders, doppelgangers, gardens — are thus constructed as the stable objects of study, which must be examined through the filter of individual novels.</Text>

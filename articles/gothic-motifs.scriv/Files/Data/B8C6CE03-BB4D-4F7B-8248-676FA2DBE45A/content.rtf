\f0\fs22 \cf2 I began by asking whether [I could actually tell men and women\'92s books apart]. [This approach asks about men\'92s and women\'92s gothics, rather than male and female gothics.\cf3  It does not assume that either actually exists.\cf2 ]\cf3  \cf2 Based on my findings, \cf0 I suggest that our attention to gender has been exactly the opposite of what i\cf3 s supported by the variety of texts produced under the Gothic umbrella\cf0 . \cf3 Although there are many Gothic features which are strongly predictive of male authorship, I find nothing that is the exclusive province of women. [I contradict the claim that \cf0 \'93it is rare for male authors to write in the \'93female\'94 style (Miles, 2000)\'94 (Ledoux 3)\cf3 ] \cf0 [Make clear that it\'92s not biologically essential, it\'92s social: if a woman brought this manuscript to a printer, it would not get published]\cf3  [In the field of Gothic studies, this work suggests that we can fold the \'93female Gothic\'94 into the unmarked category of \'93the Gothic mainstream,\'94 and begin an exploration of a \'93men\'92s Gothic.\'94] [Because only Tracy\'92s bibliography provided a reliable foundation for this research, my work also suggests [that we need increased skepticism of the biases built into the very data-collection of all research]] [Connect to broader context: must always remember that \'93data\'94 is in fact \'93capta,\'94 even/especially \'93data\'94 which does not present itself as such. Especially crucial for feminist/anti-oppressive scholars]}

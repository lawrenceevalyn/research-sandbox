\f0\fs30 \cf0 I suggest that our attention to gender has been exactly the opposite of what it should be. \
\
I follow an increasing number of scholars in turning my attention to a less prescriptive category of \'93women\'92s gothic,\'94 presumed to be united only by the fact of its\'92 creators\'92 gender, with space for marked diversity within it. I further [push for?] the category of \'93men\'92s gothic,\'94 and to the subset of men\'92s gothic which could not have been written by a woman. [Do I call that subset the Male Gothic?]}

I argue that there is, in fact, something in this model which remains fruitful: its understanding of the Gothic[\'92s history as continuous, rather than a break]. The teleologically realist model defines the Gothic as [a far point on the] spectrum of sentiment, sensation, and sensibility, all of which, Baker argues, are distinguised from each other only by \'93intensification,\'94 and not in terms of fundamental {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://2E5F7650-409C-41DC-AF1B-92967FF9E4C9"}}{\fldrslt type.}} Tompkins, too, argues for a history of continuity, saying that in the Gothic, \'93the accepted themes were repeated in a shallower tone and overlaid with all the romantic incidents of disguise, abduction, lost heirs and mistaken identity, which had been for hundreds of years the story-tellers stock in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://7D95A11F-3C88-466B-A39C-63CA232C0C48"}}{\fldrslt trade.\'94}}  [The \'93fantastic\'94 elements[, like the motifs, are very exciting, but don\'92t actually define the genre]] We can reject their realist teleology without rejecting their sensitivity to emotional response.}

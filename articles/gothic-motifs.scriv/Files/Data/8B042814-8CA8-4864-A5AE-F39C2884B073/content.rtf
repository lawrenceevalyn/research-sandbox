\f0\fs30 \cf0 A men\'92s Gothic is more elusive in Frank\'92s model.The men\'92s tags generally apply only to very few novels, reflecting a minor tradition, but there are very few of these minor men\'92s tags. Men outnumber women in the \'93Germanic\'94 tag (which encompasses \'93German\'94, \'93Germanic\'94, \'93Schauerroman\'94, \'93Rauberroman\'94, and \'93Ritterroman\'94) \'97 of these 29 Germanic Gothics, 18 are by men (62%). \'93Horror\'94, too, is disproportionately male: 42% of \'93horror\'94 works are by men, a proportion that is solidly above their baseline 31%, though not astonishing. \'93Lewisite\'94 is about the same (46% male). More strikingly male-dominated are two characteristics which would be invisible in Tracy\'92s motif-focused view: \'93polemical\'94 and \'93prototypical\'94 works. 12 works are identified as \'93proto\'94 or \'93early\'94 forms of something else; of those 12, 7 are by men (58%){\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://4A1A21B9-BE06-446D-94F2-BA70817EF3DF"}}{\fldrslt .}} A slightly larger group of works exists with the tags \'93polemical,\'94 \'93philosophical,\'94 \'93political,\'94 and \'93radical/revolutionary\'94 \'97 of these 19, 13 are by men (68%). The highest male percentage that applies to more than one work is for \'93polemical\'94 Gothics, which fiercely flog some viewpoint or another: 83% of the six \'93polemical\'94 works are by men. The masculine assessment of \'93polemical\'94 works is particularly suggestive in light of the numbers for \'93didactic\'94 works, which are entirely neutral (50% each). \'93Didactic\'94 works are the only works with a persuasive agenda in which men do not dominate, suggesting a qualitative distinction: men can produce confrontational political works, whereas the didactic is a more equal-opportunity field in which women, too, can promote their ideas under the aegis of instruction.}

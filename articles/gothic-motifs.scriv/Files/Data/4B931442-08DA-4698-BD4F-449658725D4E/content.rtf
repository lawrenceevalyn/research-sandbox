\f0\fs22 \cf2 It is necessary for new knowledge to be built upon the foundations of former knowledge; but equally it is necessary to re-investigate the truth of what is \'93known.\'94 This project revives two qualitative bibliographies from the 1980s to seek gendered patterns of writing on the scale of hundreds of texts. Implicit in this approach is a methodological critique: [for an aspect of writing to merit discussion in gendered terms, it ought to correlate with authorial gender]. Given the social reality of gender, it does not require gender essentialism to hypothesize that men and women might have [different horizons of publishability]. [The realities of gender are relevant to the work of feminist scholarship, and to the challenging of patriarchal narratives.] [But gender essentialism is equally dangerous to these aims.] [The middle path I chart takes a sociological[?] approach, at a larger scale than individual texts, which not only treats gender as only one possible (weak) factor of influence, but indeed treats gendered difference itself as the [thing] to be proven.] [[Using bibliographies prevents me from re-inventing the wheel, and also lets me \'93check\'94 past work to see how, and how much, we can repurpose older work.]]\cf3  \cf4 [TODO: add a transition to make Tracy & and Frank less abrupt] \cf3 In the end, I find that\cf4 , although Ann Tracy\'92s bibliography can be re-used,\cf3  \cf0 Frederick Frank\'92s bibliography is shaped inextricably and irretrievably by the sexism of the time\cf2 .\cf0  \cf4  \cf2 E\cf0 ven though we \'93already know\'94 that older scholarship is sexist, this experiment shows how difficult it is to build on those foundations / correct them\cf2 .}

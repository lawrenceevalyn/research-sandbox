\f0\fs22 \cf2 This project ultimately reinforces Ledoux\'92s argument that the Female Gothic is a retroactive critical creation. Frederick Frank\'92s critical categories paint a picture of Radcliffe as the centre of a group of female, sentimental copiers. But Ann Tracy\'92s less-critically-mediated details present us with a largely undifferentiated gothic mainstream, in which the only gendered pocket is a group of male writers whose gender gives them license to go to extremes.}

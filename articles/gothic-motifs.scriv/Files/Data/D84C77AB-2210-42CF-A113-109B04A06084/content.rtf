However, Frank\'92s model does point toward a [female] gendered tradition in Radcliffean and sentimental novels. Frank identifies twelve novels as explicit imitations of Radcliffe; the \'93Radcliffe\'94 tag includes those twelve, and Radcliffe\'92s own six novels \'97 and all eighteen are by women. Nearly as strongly predictive of female authorship is the \'93sentimental\'94 tag (92% female). [Tracy\'92s model was not sensitive to these features because they are not defined by individual plot devices.] [By looking at which Gothic types go together, a Female Gothic emerges.] Approaching from one direction, half of the Radcliffean novels are also high Gothic. If you know a book is Radcliffean, you know it is probably high Gothic, terror mode, and sentimental, in that order. Approaching from the other direction, a quarter of sentimental novels are also Radcliffean. If you know a book is sentimental, you know it is probably [????]. The Gothic types which are likely to include Radcliffean novels are sentimental, naturalized or explained, and high Gothic, in that order.}

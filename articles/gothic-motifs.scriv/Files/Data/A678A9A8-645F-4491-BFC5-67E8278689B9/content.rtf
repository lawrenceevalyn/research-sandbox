\f0\fs30 \cf0 Frank\'92s women\'92s Gothic challenges few stereotypes of women\'92s writing. He indexes slightly more female authors than {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://4F5E4B34-308D-4BA4-BFB5-A2ECFBC3B0F3"}}{\fldrslt male}}. Three of the most popular tags are even more female-dominated than his woman-heavy sample would lead us to expect: 43% of Frank\'92s corpus is written by women, but that 43% is responsible for 50% of the \'93terror\'94 works, 65% of the \'93Radcliffean\'94 works, and a striking 77% of the \'93sentimental.\'94 Contemporary criticism has worked to revise the eighteenth-century consensus that the literary sphere was overtaken with a flood of dangerous sentimental literature by and for women: Barbara Benedict, for example, ruthlessly debunks a range of \'93manifestly untrue\'94 eighteenth-century perceptions of reading demographics{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://5F9DA29A-FE3B-4F3F-A148-973B284BCF4B"}}{\fldrslt ,}} and many others have agreed that most readers and most writers were men, and even that men and women mostly read the same things. However, the preponderance of women writing Frank\'92s sentimental works suggests a kernel of truth underlying eighteenth-century critics\'92 panic. It is entirely possible for readers to be mostly male, and authors mostly male, even within the sphere of specifically Gothic publishing, but for female authors to nonetheless write a detectably feminine kind of book. Frank presents us with a Radcliffean, sentimental, terror Gothic which is also a women\'92s Gothic.}

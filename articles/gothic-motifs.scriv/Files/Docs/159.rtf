I touch on the implications that these finding might have for the way we understand Ann Radcliffe\'92s works, but my primary interest is in the \'91school of Radcliffe\'92 itself. This \'91school\'92 was, evidently, readily identifieable to Radcliffe\'92s contemporaries, but I argue that its identifying features are not entirely those which seem most notable to modern critics. [I see a historically-defined, socially-shaped \'91school of Radcliffe\'92 which involves primarily female authors, and distinguish this from the critical construction of a \'91Female Gothic\'92.]}

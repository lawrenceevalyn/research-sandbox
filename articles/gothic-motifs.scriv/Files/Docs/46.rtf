\f1\fs32 \cf2 In determining my approach, I draw upon McCarty\'92s framework of the strengths and limits of \'93modeling,\'94 with influence from Samuels and McGann\'92s discussion of \'93deformance,\'94 to allow for models which are sensitive to certain distinctions but not to others. McCarty, in proposing language to discuss literary models and their epistemological implications, elaborates upon a distinction made by Clifford Geertz between models \'93of\'94 something and models \'93for\'94 something (McCarty). Blueprints 
\f0\i of

\fs32 \up0 After much experimentation, I have opted not to pursue analysis of the words of any actual texts, whether literary or bibliographic. Certainly, the early Gothic is uncharted territory for computational stylometry; the one corpus-based analysis which I was able to discover, an MSc dissertation by Stephanie Jones (2010), begins its investigation in 1816, well past the Gothic\'92s first flourishing. However, full-text analysis relies on having full texts, which are readily available only for the most critically-examined novels. It is the nature of my project to rely on the work of my scholarly predecessors, but I did not wish to replicate this emphasis of attention.

\f1\fs32 ideas to be explored before they are brought into reality; both ways of modeling \'93comprise a practical means of playing out the consequences of an idea in the real world\'94 (McCarty), from two different directions. My several attempts to model the Gothic novel, as a genre experienced by its popular readership in the late eighteenth century, are certainly models 
\f0\i of 
\f1\i0 that genre. As such, their merit at first seems most appropriately evaluated in terms of their compliance with the \'93fundamental principle\'94 of modeling-of, namely, the \'93exact correspondence between model and object with respect to the webs of relationships among the selected elements in each\'94 (McCarty). By this principle, my essay ought to focus on those preliminary models which retained the most detail about the texts in question: Tracy\'92s plot summaries, for example, or even a much-smaller corpus containing full texts of famous Gothics. However, as McCarty ultimately concludes, \'93modeling is pragmatic\'94 (McCarty); immediately after defining the \'93fundamental principle\'94 of \'93exact correspondence,\'94 McCarty describes two reasons it may be violated: when exact correspondence is impossible for practical reasons, and when it has been intentionally distorted in order to study the effects of those distortions. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs32 Exact correspondence is, of course, never a practical option; if there have been no adjustments of scale or materials, the object of study is no longer a model at all, but the thing itself. Tautologically, models are only needed when the thing itself is in some way unsuitable for study\'97 too big, too complicated, or no longer in complete existence\'97 and so models are always ultimately \'93fictional\'94 (McCarty). Because these fictions have been created with particular goals in mind\'97because, McCarty says, \'93modeling is pragmatic\'94\'97he argues that \'93the worth of a model must be judged by its fruitfulness\'94 (McCarty). Stephen Ramsay\'92s \'93Algorithmic Criticism\'94 provides a metric for evaluating that fruitfulness: \'93the robustness of the discussion that a particular procedure annunciates\'94 (Ramsay). This seems to be what McCarty implicitly means 
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs32 Lawrence Evalyn 4 
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs32 when he terms something \'93fruitful\'94: whether or not the model has revealed what we expected, it has revealed something with which we must now engage. Exact correspondence is thus less of a \'93fundamental principle\'94 (McCarty), and more of an imagined destination that spurs valuable journeys. As a model is constructed, it becomes sensitive to some areas of difference while eliding others. Models need not be perfectly accurate, only sensitive to the desired area of difference. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs32 McCarty also describes models which are not merely partial in some particular set of details, but which \'93deliberately\'94 diverge from their source \'93in order to study the consequences\'94 of the changes. McCarty terms these intentional manipulations \'93distortion,\'94 but Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann might call them \'93deformance.\'94 I take this term from their essay \'93Deformance and Interpretation,\'94 which seeks to untangle the mechanics of interpretation as a critical act, and the ways in which interpretation distorts artistic works in service of its own performative operations.

\fs32 \up0 For a recognition of the methodologies of \'93ordinary \'91paper based\'92 literary criticism\'94 (Ramsay), I could also have taken Stephen Ramsay\'92s \'93Algorithmic Criticism\'94 as my foundation. Ramsay argues that \'93[a]ny reading of a text... relies on a heuristic of radical transformation\'94 (Ramsay), noting that \'93[t]he critic who endeavors to put forth a \'91reading,\'92 puts forth not the text, but a new text in which the data has been paraphrased, elaborated, selected, truncated, and transduced\'94 (Ramsay). However, Ramsay ultimately subordinates his computational experiments to \'93the grander rhetorical formations that constitute critical reading\'94 (Ramsay). I take Samuels and McGann as my starting-place largely for their willingness to treat their created texts seriously as new and separate objects of interpretation.

\f1\fs32 nonnormative readings of established cultural artifacts\'94 (35), typically undertaken in service of a particular point, constitute deformation. Placing themselves in this tradition, Samuels and McGann apply several deformative interpretive approaches to the poetry of Wallace Stevens. Each deformation is a procedure for rewriting a poem \'97 reordering its lines from last to first, or deleting all the words but the nouns or the verbs \'97 which spurs a new interpretation of the new version of the text. The key advantage of these deformations is a fruitful defamiliarization of the object of study: the procedure \'93reinstalls the text \'97 any text, prose or verse \'97 as a performative event, a made thing\'94 (30) by rendering the mechanics of its creation salient. When readers cannot ignore the critic\'92s act of re-writing, we are implicitly asked to engage again with the author\'92s earlier act of writing. This defamiliarization allows us to \'93imagine things about the text that we did not and perhaps could not otherwise know\'94 (36), because we have been re-sensitized to new details of the work. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs32 It is through this new sensitivity that Samuels and McGann begin to echo McCarty. The two essays at first seem to be concerned with very different approaches, but they converge by way of Leah Price. In 
\f0\i The Anthology and the Rise of the Novel
\f1\i0 , Price draws attention to the ways in which all reading, and particularly all scholarly writing, must involve a constant re-editing of texts, influenced by memory and argument. In keeping with Samuels and McGann\'92s classification of \'93[e]laborate scholarly editions\'94 (33) as deformative criticism, Price argues that any edited text \'97 \'91elaborate\'92 or not \'97 produces, not a flawed or distorted copy of the original, but a new text. The process of editing a text must always reveal the editor\'92s \'93unspoken assumptions about the most efficient way to convey information, and indeed what counts as information at all\'94 (13), and thus gives us a new thing to examine. As Price observes, when scholars examine texts\'97 when we take notes on them, extract quotes for close reading,

\f1\fs32 summarize or categorize scenes, chapters, or books\'97 our act of reading is also one of editing. McCarty allows us to recognize that this mental editing is not a sign of scholarly weakness, but a model, made necessary by the limits of human memory. Price\'92s project is more interested in the literal anthologizing undertaken by publishers than in the mental anthologizing implicit in the scholarly act of thinking about several books at once; her ultimate argument is about the works of George Eliot, not about the methodology of literary criticism. Nonetheless, her observations, once anthologized in abridged form alongside digital humanities thinkers, allows us to \'91bare the devices\'92 of literary criticism itself. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs32 My own modeling framework is informed by all of these. My key ideas are sensitivity in data selection, and procedurality in visual representation. My two \'91texts\'92 \'96 Tracy\'92s and Frank\'92s bibliographies \'96 are themselves two very different deformative models of \'91The Gothic Novel,\'92 and each render different distinctions more or less salient. When forming my research questions, I begin by asking what a given source of information allows me to be sensitive to. Tracy\'92s motifs emphasize events and singular images, with each detail systematically tallied. In contrast, Frank\'92s Gothic types emphasize a work\'92s overall tone, and his evaluations are at times maddeningly qualitative and subtle. The two are thus able to usefully complement each other. As I work with these texts, I dwell upon procedure as a way to meditate upon the implications of earlier critics\'92 frameworks. Because I must iterate all of my decisions at least 178 times when I decide to include a new axis of distinction in my spreadsheet, much of my \'91research\'92 has been developing procedures that work 
\f0\i with 
\f1\i0 each model, deforming books into spreadsheets and then into images in ways that will render their implicit models explicit and obvious. Rather than visualizing data, then, my goal has been to grasp models. The procedure of graphing each

We also have to pay attention[?], in Frank, to the many \'93unsigned\'94 authors. The tags in which unsigned authors outnumber male and female authors combined mostly point to the conditions of those works\'92 publication: 28 of the 78 \'93chapbook/bluebook\'94 works (68%) are written by authors of unknown gender;  8 of 9 \'93plagiarism/abridgement\'94 (88%), all five \'93shilling\'94, all five \'93novella\'94, and 6 of 9 \'93serialized\'94 (66%).  [This suggests that unsigned/unknown authors are basically doing the same thing as what everyone else is doing \'97 the only way we can tell them apart is by seeing that they\'92ve published in a mode in which authorship attribution is scarce.] The only exception is \'93Clara Reeve\'94: 4 of 6 works inspired by Reeve have authors of unknown gender. [Walpole also inspires unsigned authors, 5 of 12 (42%, less than half but well above the 26% baseline] [But I don\'92t know why any of this is interesting.]\

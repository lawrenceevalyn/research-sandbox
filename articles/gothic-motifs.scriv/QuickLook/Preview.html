<p class="binderItem"><strong>Abstract</strong><br/>This paper examines more than five hundred pre-Victorian Gothic works to ask whether female writers created categorically different works than their male peers. Two qualitative bibliographies of the Gothic provide “motifs” and “Gothic types” for computational modelling. In these models, many of the literary features which have been attributed to the ‘Female Gothic’ or to the ‘school of Radcliffe’ are, in fact, particular to Ann Radcliffe herself. Radcliffe thus stands in contrast to Matthew Lewi...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>women's gothic, not female gothic</strong><br/>By turning to the late eighteenth-century Gothic, and particularly the troublesome category of “the female Gothic”, I examine a mass of books that have been vaguely disreputable since they were first published. At its inception and for most of its literary history, criticism of Gothic emotional excess or implausible machinery generally went hand-in-hand with dismissals of the genre as unserious due to its perceived alignment with women. In the 1980s, feminist critics like Juliann Fleenor enabled...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>theory: my bibs have thin description</strong><br/>My theoretical approach emphasizes the continuities between computational approaches to literature and the the venerable tradition of archival bibliographical research. Heather Love has notably turned to sociological microanalysis as a model for 'thin description' close-but-not-deep reading methods; I employ qualitative computational modelling as another method which seeks the same goals. Love emphasizes thin description as not just “fine-grained” but “exhaustive” (and possibly exhausting) but w...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>bibliographies</strong><br/>Having declared an interest in eighteenth century novels and bibliographic research, Peter Garside and James Raven’s monumental The English Novel, 1770–1829 immediately demands consideration. Lee Erickson aptly called it “magnificent” for its scope. But is is Garside’s scope which works against this project; instead, I will use two earlier bibliographies, by Ann Tracy and Frederick Frank, which are more partial, qualitative, and idiosyncratic — features which may not recommend a bibliography as ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>I'm modelling here</strong><br/>Although I will use a number of graphs to make my argument, the key term for my methodological approach is not “data visualization,” but “modelling.” Johanna Drucker has given compelling warnings about the dangers of treating constructed information as empirically objective “data” which may then be passively “visualized”. Willard McCarty’s discussion of models as both “pragmatic” and “fictive” is more accurate to the scholarly process of gathering, classifying, correlating, and interpreting info...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Frank and Tracy are models</strong><br/>My two ‘texts’ — bibliographies by Ann Tracy and Frederick Frank — are thus themselves models of “The Gothic Novel.” Because, as Price observes, the process of editing a text must always reveal the editor’s “unspoken assumptions about the most efficient way to convey information, and indeed what counts as information at all,” the editorial processes behind each bibliography makes each one sensitive to very different concerns. Ann Tracy’s The Gothic Novel 1790-1830: Plot Summaries and Index to Mo...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Tracy values uniqueness</strong><br/>Tracy’s bibliography is built to be more like a particularly helpful finding aid than a comprehensive check-list.  Her most unusual qualitative bibliographical work is her ten-page “Index to Motifs” identifying the books in which 208 different “motifs” appear. Tracy uses the term “motif” broadly to encompass a wide range of plot elements, images, and character types. The index is intended for “scholars with particular interests”, who wish to locate and read books containing individual story elem...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>my model of Tracy</strong><br/>I take Tracy’s model to its logical extension by foregrounding her motifs. I distilled her index of 208 motifs into 92 charts of motifs which appear in at least 20 works. Using her model to investigate the possibility of a women’s Gothic, I examine the potential predictive power of each motif. I ask whether the presence of any given motif in a work constitutes meaningful information regarding the probable gender of that work’s author. A series of procedural design choices emphasizes the qualitat...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>men's Gothic</strong><br/>Comparing these male-dominated motifs to the neutral or female-dominated motifs involves constant escalation. Women may write about libertines (64% female), whose seductions may be coercive and almost always end poorly for their victims, but men write about the act of rape itself (75% male). Tracy’s motifs suggest that the darkest side of the Gothic was primarily the province of men: death is female-dominated when it is sad or pious (61% female), but murder is male-dominated (64% male), as are b...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>subterranean passages</strong><br/>In contrast to this abundance of male-dominated tropes, female-authored tropes are elusive. The Radcliffean plot elements of subterranean passages (61% male), caves (61% male), and secret doors (59% male) turn out to be firmly correlated with male authors, not female. This is not to say that these motifs are not Radcliffean: Radcliffe alone accounts for 7% of all caves, 11% of all secret doors, and an astonishing 15% of all subterannean passages. Indeed, she is the top author for both subterrane...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>women's Gothic</strong><br/>Instead, in this model of the genre, the women’s Gothic seems to be defined by only four things: libertines (64% female), forced weddings (62% female), sad or pious deaths (61% female), and miniature portraits (61% female). The libertines and miniature portraits in particular, as the most common female motifs, immediately suggest a women’s Gothic that is in striking conversation with novels like Jane Austen’s, whose ordered and rational novels are nonetheless repelete with rakes and miniatures. ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>mainstream Gothic</strong><br/>More than half of the motifs under consideration are not strongly gendered in either direction. Four are even perfect ties: elopement (all subcategories); dueling and other single combat; fainting, female; and rediscovery of lost relatives. Moreover, the more popular a motif is — that is, the larger a role it plays in constituting the default expectations of the genre — the more likely it is to be non-gendered. Indeed, all of the strongly male-dominated motifs are much less common than the more ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>no binaries</strong><br/>This motif-based model of the early Gothic suggests that, rather than a balanced oppositions of Radcliffe’s female terror Gothic versus Lewis’s male horror Gothic, the genre as a popular movement was defined by a less-sensationalist (possibly Radcliffean, possibly terror-mode) non-genered Gothic mainstream, with a subset of male horror Gothic writers making up a minor tradition within it. These results serve as a useful reminder that not all contrasts are perfect binaries; the existence of a men...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Frank values context</strong><br/>Having explored one bibliographic model in depth, we now have a point of comparison for our next model of men and women’s Gothics. Although it attempts to model the same field, Frederick Frank’s bibliography encourages a very different understanding of the texts he indexes. Unlike Tracy, Frank is interested in not just what happens, but in how it happens. His “Critical Synopsis” of each text functions entirely differently from Tracy’s “Plot Summary,” often providing very few plot details in favo...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>my model of Frank</strong><br/>Adapting Frank’s model for my own, then, required working somewhat against the grain of his assumptions. However, I have avoided simply assigning each text one simple genre. Instead, I have separated out each strand of influence within his complex “Gothic types”  by dividing each “type” into a set of tags, and tallied the uses of each tag. This process generated 190 unique tags, most of which only applied to one or two works. By rendering the tags individually listable, my model imposes a more s...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>women's Gothic</strong><br/>Frank’s women’s Gothic challenges few stereotypes of women’s writing. Like Tracy, he indexes slightly more female authors than male. Three of the most popular tags are even more female-dominated than his woman-heavy sample would lead us to expect: 43% of Frank’s corpus is written by women, but that 43% is responsible for 50% of the “terror” works, 65% of the “Radcliffean” works, and a striking 77% of the “sentimental.” Contemporary criticism has worked to revise the eighteenth-century consensus ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>men's Gothic</strong><br/>A men’s Gothic is more elusive in Frank’s model. Like in Tracy, the men’s tags generally apply only to very few novels, reflecting a minor tradition. Unlike in Tracy, there are very few of these minor men’s tags. The ones that do exist reinforce the conclusions we drew more strongly based on Tracy’s model. Men outnumber women in the “Germanic” tag (which encompasses “German”, “Germanic”, “Schauerroman”, “Rauberroman”, and “Ritterroman”) — of these 29 Germanic Gothics, 18 are by men (62%). “Horro...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>mainstream Gothic</strong><br/>Frank’s Gothic mainstream is largely non-gendered. The two most prevalent tags in the corpus as a whole, representing all Gothics without attention paid to authorial gender, are “Gothic” (83% of all works) and “pure/high” (39%), both of which have the same gendered distribution of the sample as a whole. Our only hint of a gendered trend among the most widespread tags is the third most prevalent tag, “terror” (34% of works), which, at 50% female, is somewhat above the female baseline of 43%. The ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>this CRIES OUT for correlation</strong><br/>Attempting to compare the two models raises the prospect of combining them. It’s been an open question to this point whether Frank’s Gothic types respond to actually gendered usage, or impose their interpretations based on subsequent gendered expectation. When it comes to assessing a work as “polemical” versus “didactic”, for example, the tone difference is a subjective interpretation which could easily be influenced by his knowledge of the author’s gender. In contrast, Tracy’s boolean motifs — ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>some horror motifs</strong><br/>The “horror” tag, certainly, is associated with a number of motifs. Predictably, too, the “horror” motifs look similar to the men’s motifs. At the top of the list of “horror” motifs is “Inquisition” — 63% of “horror” Gothics include the Inquisition, an enormous increase over the baseline 15% presence of that motif. This striking result lends credence to the work of scholars like Robert Miles who take conspiracy as a central horror-Gothic concern. Next, less expectedly, are secret doors, at the e...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>weaker terror motifs</strong><br/>The “terror” tag, as expected, is less strongly defined by its motifs. Several motifs do appear with slightly higher frequency within “terror” works than in the baseline, but generally only by a few percentage points. 43 motifs appear in “horror” works with a 20% or greater increase in frequency over their baseline prevalence, but not one motif crosses that threshold for “terror.” If we examine the top of the “terror” list anyway, the tag shows an anemic increase in fainting (19% more than basel...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Frank-and-Tracy-based conclusion</strong><br/>This correlation confirms a conclusion drawn from examining just Tracy’s motifs, that the men’s Gothic might operate via striking images but the women’s Gothic less so. Men’s horror is a minor tradition within the genre, easy to single out for censure but not the most widely-imitated. Men’s and women’s schools do indeed exist, but that they do not map neatly to a set of female/male terror/horror Radcliffe/Lewis binaries, and that both gendered schools are dwarfed by a largely non-gendered Gothic...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">opening: the mass of Radcliffean imitators</p>
<p class="itemText">The Gothic novel in the 1790s comes with its own conventional narrative. Ann Radcliffe, the “Great Enchantress,” enthrals audiences for a decade with literary blockbusters which are gobbled up by women who scribble their own novels in response. The marketplace is glutted with these unskilled copies of Radcliffe, written by authoresses eager for Radcliffe’s fame or her financial security, trying to replicate Radcliffe’s formula. The popularity of this “school of Radcliffe” is both its threat and ...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">history of the Female Gothic</p>
<p class="itemText">This “obviously” female-associated phenomenon led to the critical category of the “Female Gothic” to discuss narratives of women in patriarchal distress. [Retell some conventional definitions here]</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Ledoux lists off the standard requirements — “a distressed heroine, domestic incarceration, threats of sexual violence, anxiety about monstrous or absent mothers” (2) — “women’s domestic incarceration, sexual violence, economic disenfranchisement and spectral maternity” (2)</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Male Gothic less often / well defined</p>
<p class="itemText">There is less consensus around the Male Gothic.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">In the context of attaching the Female Gothic to “the ‘explained supernatural style’” (3), Ledoux also provides definition for the Male Gothic, “in which ghosts, devils and other supernatural phenomena demand a willful suspension of disbelief from the reader” (3)</p>
<p class="itemText">I’m surprised to hear Ledoux refer to “the ‘Male Gothic,’ made famous by Horace Walpole and Matthew Lewis” (3), since Walpole is not at all a ‘horror gothic’ writer.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Ledoux: Female Gothic isn't real</p>
<p class="itemText">From this literary history, Ledoux concludes that “the category “Female Gothic” more accurately reflects the ideological goals of second-wave feminist literary criticism than it represents the narratives of early women Gothic writers” (2)</p>
<p class="itemText">Despite many scholars’ work showing that “women’s early Gothic writing— a great deal of which is only accessible to us because of the recovery work of feminist scholars—is much more aesthetically, politically, thematically, and generically diverse than the Fema...</p>

<p class="itemText">I suggest that our attention to gender has been exactly the opposite of what it should be. </p>
<p class="itemText">I follow an increasing number of scholars in turning my attention to a less prescriptive category of “women’s gothic,” presumed to be united only by the fact of its’ creators’ gender, with space for marked diversity within it. I further [push for?] the category of “men’s gothic,” and especially the subset of men’s gothic which...</p>

<p class="itemText">I am interested in gendered trends that hold true for large numbers of authors [actually tied to gender, not authors’ individuality]. I am particularly interested in trends that could have predictive power: rather than speculating about a book’s meaning based on its author’s gender, I set out to ask whether, in fast, there is anything in a book’s content that would allow us to speculate on its author’s gender.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">theory: my bibs have thin description</p>
<p class="itemText">My theoretical approach emphasizes the continuities between computational approaches to literature and the the venerable tradition of archival bibliographical research. Heather Love has notably turned to sociological microanalysis as a model for 'thin description' close-but-not-deep reading methods; I employ qualitative computational modelling as another method which seeks the same goals. Love emphasizes thin description as not just “fine-grained” but “exhaustive” (and possibly exhausting) but w...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">I'm modelling here</p>
<p class="itemText">Although I will use a number of graphs to make my argument, the key term for my methodological approach is not “data visualization,” but “modelling.” Johanna Drucker has given compelling warnings about the dangers of treating constructed information as empirically objective “data” which may then be passively “visualized”. Willard McCarty’s discussion of models as both “pragmatic” and “fictive” is more accurate to the scholarly process of gathering, classifying, correlating, and interpreting info...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Frank and Tracy are models</p>
<p class="itemText">My two ‘texts’ — bibliographies by Ann Tracy and Frederick Frank — are thus themselves models of “The Gothic Novel.” Because, as Price observes, the process of editing a text must always reveal the editor’s “unspoken assumptions about the most efficient way to convey information, and indeed what counts as information at all,” the editorial processes behind each bibliography makes each one sensitive to very different concerns. Ann Tracy’s The Gothic Novel 1790-1830: Plot Summaries and Index to Mo...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">key findings up front</p>
<p class="itemText">This project ultimately reinforces Ledoux’s argument that the Female Gothic is a retroactive critical creation. Frederick Frank’s critical categories paint a picture of Radcliffe as the centre of a group of female, sentimental copiers. But Ann Tracy’s less-critically-mediated details present us with a largely undifferentiated gothic mainstream, in which the only gendered pocket is a group of male writers whose gender gives them license to go to extremes.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Frank's model</p>
<p class="itemText">Let us begin with Frederick Frank’s picture of the Female Gothic.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Frank’s records of each text try to capture impressive nuance and context. He offers a “Gothic Type” and a “Critical Synopsis” of each text to place it within the critical consensus. His “Critical Synopsis” often provides very few plot details in favour of describing the work’s literary borrowings, narrative structure, and historical reception. His Gothic “types” are not stable overarching categories: for his 500 texts, Frank pro...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">my model of Frank</p>
<p class="itemText">Adapting Frank’s model for my own, then, required working somewhat against the grain of his assumptions. However, I have avoided simply assigning each text one simple genre. Instead, I have separated out each strand of influence within his complex “Gothic types”  by dividing each “type” into a set of tags, and tallied the uses of each tag. This process generated 190 unique tags, most of which only applied to one or two works. By rendering the tags individually listable, my model imposes a more s...</p>

<p class="itemText">The demographics of Frank’s genre tags would seem to strongly support a category of the “Female Gothic.”</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Frank’s women’s Gothic challenges few stereotypes of women’s writing. He indexes slightly more female authors than male. Three of the most popular tags are even more female-dominated than his woman-heavy sample would lead us to expect: 43% of Frank’s corpus is written by women, but that 43% is responsible for 50% of t...</p>

<p class="itemText">A men’s Gothic is more elusive in Frank’s model. Very few tags are applied to men’s works more often than to women’s. When a tag is male dominated, it generally applies to only a few novels (FOR EXAMPLE…), giving the impression of a one-off rather than a gendered school.</p>

<p class="itemText">Frank’s Gothic mainstream is largely non-gendered. The two most prevalent tags in the corpus as a whole, representing all Gothics without attention paid to authorial gender, are “Gothic” (83% of all works) and “pure/high” (39%), both of which have the same gendered distribution of the sample as a whole. Our only hint of a gendered trend among the most widespread tags is the third most prevalent tag, “terror” (34% of works...</p>

<p class="itemText">Tracy’s bibliography is built to be more like a particularly helpful finding aid than a comprehensive check-list.  Her most unusual qualitative bibliographical work is her ten-page “Index to Motifs” identifying the books in which 208 different “motifs” appear. Tracy uses the term “motif” broadly to encompass a wide range of plot elements, images, and character types. The index is intended for “scholars with particular interests”, who wish to locate and read books co...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">my model of Tracy</p>
<p class="itemText">I take Tracy’s model to its logical extension by foregrounding her motifs. I distilled her index of 208 motifs into 92 charts of motifs which appear in at least 20 works. Using her model to investigate the possibility of a women’s Gothic, I examine the potential predictive power of each motif. I ask whether the presence of any given motif in a work constitutes meaningful information regarding the probable gender of that work’s author. A series of procedural design choices emphasizes the qualitat...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">men's Gothic</p>
<p class="itemText">Comparing these male-dominated motifs to the neutral or female-dominated motifs involves constant escalation. Women may write about libertines (64% female), whose seductions may be coercive and almost always end poorly for their victims, but men write about the act of rape itself (75% male). Tracy’s motifs suggest that the darkest side of the Gothic was primarily the province of men: death is female-dominated when it is sad or pious (61% female), but murder is male-dominated (64% male), as are b...</p>

<p class="itemText">The “horror” tag, certainly, is associated with a number of motifs. Predictably, too, the “horror” motifs look similar to the men’s motifs. At the top of the list of “horror” motifs is “Inquisition” — 63% of “horror” Gothics include the Inquisition, an enormous increase over the baseline 15% presence of that motif. This striking result lends credence to the work of scholars like Robert Miles who take conspiracy as a centra...</p>

Several motifs do appear with slightly higher frequency within “terror” works than in the baseline, but generally only by a few percentage points. 43 motifs appear in “horror” works with a 20% or greater increase in frequency over their baseline prevalence, but not one motif crosses that threshold for “terror.” If we examine the top of the “terror” lis...</p>

Four are even perfect ties: elopement (all subcategories); duelling and other single combat; fainting, female; and rediscovery of lost relatives. Moreover, the more popular a motif is — that is, the larger a role it plays in constituting the default expectations of the genre — the more likely it is to be non-gendered. Indeed, al...</p>

The Radcliffean plot elements of subterranean passages (61% male), caves (61% male), and secret doors (59% male) turn out to be firmly correlated with male authors, not female.

Title: gothic-motifs
Author: Lawrence Evalyn

# abstract #

[This paper asks how to identify and discuss gendered trends.] This paper examines more than five hundred pre-Victorian Gothic works to ask whether female writers created categorically different works than their male peers, [looking for predictive power.] Two qualitative bibliographies of the Gothic provide “motifs” and “Gothic types” for computational modelling.  [There’s no female gothic, but there is a male gothic.]

Women Aren’t Weird, Men Are Weird (And We’re Sexist)

# what makes a trend gendered? #

How are we to identify or discuss gendered trends in literature? My answer: have to look at at least a hundred texts. [DH marries nuance with scale]

# need predictive power #

My answer: the supposedly distinguishing element ought to have predictive power

# Frank shows a female Gothic #

Frank’s female Gothic sounds familiar

# but Frank's female gothic is a critical artefact #

Also, doesn’t correlate with anything in Tracy

# (terror / horror motifs enhance Frank/Tracy correlations?) #

# Radcliffe is a weirdo #

The things that we might expect — subterannean passages and caves — are just Radcliffe.

# Tracy does show a male Gothic #

Men can write whatever wacky stuff they want

# men aren't default, they're shaped by gender #

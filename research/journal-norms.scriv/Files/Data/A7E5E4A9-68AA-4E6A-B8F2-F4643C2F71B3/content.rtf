\f0\fs22 \cf0 "Submissions to DSCN focus on the intersection of technology and humanities research. Articles on the application of technology to cultural, historical, and social problems, on the societal and institutional context of such applications, and the history and development of the field of Digital Humanities. Submissions focussing on issues of the practice of the Digital Humanities in a global, multi-cultural, or multi-lingual context are particularly encouraged.\
As a rule, submissions to DSCN should be of generalisable import: project reports and technical notes are welcome when they discuss significant milestones in the history and development of the field or are clearly extensible."}

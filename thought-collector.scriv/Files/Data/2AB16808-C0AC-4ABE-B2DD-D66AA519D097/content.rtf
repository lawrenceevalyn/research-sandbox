\f0\fs22 \cf0 IS the sentimental novel part of what I am trying to do here?? Just had a great talk with Ashley about the development of the sentimental novel -- 1750s tied to religion, mostly men; 1770s still male and respectable and now emotion as its own moral code; 1790s develop it into revolutionary sentiment, becoming tied to women; by 1810 it's been subsumed into women's Gothic writing and lost its potential for respectability\
Narrative fragmentation and suspense typical of the sentimental novel is also hugely typical of the Gothic -- Vicar of Wakefield and Man of Feeling both cut away from dramatic moments, withhold information, intentionally sustain anxiety. The Gothic is a natural amplification! But instead of catharsis through tears, it... all gets resolved into rationality?}

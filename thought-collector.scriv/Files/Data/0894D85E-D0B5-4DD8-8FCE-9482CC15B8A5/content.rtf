\f0\fs22 \cf0 I argue for organization by publication date over composition only partly because publication is more likely to be feasible. Many works in the period circulated as manuscripts or in private readings before publication (even Austen!) but it is the point of publication which marks an intentional, temporally-fixed/timely entry into a broader public conversation.}

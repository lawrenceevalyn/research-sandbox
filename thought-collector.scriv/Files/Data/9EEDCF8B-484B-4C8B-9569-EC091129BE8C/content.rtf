\f0\b\fs22 \cf0 A chronological anthology is structured by the assu,ption that the most important context for a work is not who it is by, but when it was produced. Author comes second.
\b0  This reverses the traditional anthology (Norton etc), which is structured by the assumption that the most important context for a work is the author who produced it, with chronology as a second concern.\
Author is of course an important component! But it can also promote the false idea that changes within an author\'92s body of work are mostly due to personal matters or artistic evolution, rather than being responses to other works being produced or to changes in the world at large. }

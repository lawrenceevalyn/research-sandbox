\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 This dissertation enters into a conversation that marks a shift in how to understand late eighteenth-century English literature. It resists both the history of the novel as a teleological one, where each prose work is another step\cb1  along the path to realism; and a history of Romanticism that centres on the poets\'92 own myth-making. It thus seeks to follow in the footsteps of scholars such as Michael Gamer, by paying car\cb3 eful attention to the interdependence of generic forms, while casting a much broader net. On a methodological level, this dissertation also engages in current debates about \'93surface reading\'94 or \'93literal reading\'94 as undertaken by Sharon Marcus, Heather Love, and Stephen Best, and paranoid modes of criticism resisted in the work of, among others, Eve Sedgwick and Rita Felski. I want to propose the \'93distant reading\'94 methods promoted by Franco Moretti as one possible means of achieving meaningful surface reading and rich description\cb1 . Finally, the computational approaches to literary corpora, including new algorithms that I will develop through the research process, will contribute substantively to \'a0the field of the digital humanities, even though these techniques are not the primary motivation for the work I am undertaking in the dissertation. }

\f0\fs22 \cf0 the Glowworm The poem, \'91Among all lovely things my Love had been\'92, W\'92s gift to D on his return from seeing Mary in Middleham the previous week; see 20 Apr. 1802 for an account of the poem\'92s composition on horseback (Calvert\'92s horse). It is about the finding of a glow-worm for \'91Lucy\'92 to see. \'91The incident\'92, wrote W when he copied it out to send to C that same night on reaching Grasmere, \'91took place about seven years ago between Dorothy and me\'92 (EY, p. 348). The gesture was delicate at Racedown in 1795, and the poem about it is particularly delicate in Apr. 1802; it clearly did reassure D that W\'92s intended marriage would mean no diminution of his love for her.}

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 I will then turn my attention to a broad corpus of works available to me as full texts. The ECCO-TCP pr\cb3 ovides carefully-edited full texts of 2,188 works from 1701-1800, of which 502 were published during the decade of interest to me. I may supplement these texts with works from other, smaller scholarly corpora, such as the Chawton House Library corpus of women\'92s writing; Women Writers Online; the Oxford Text Archive; and digital library holdings like those at the University of Indiana and the University of Michigan. As a first measure, I will \cb1 compare what is included in these corpora to the more comprehensive ESTC corpus to see how\cb3  each archive models the decade. I am particularly curious to \cb1 compare\cb3  the way that each corpus represents the prominence of my key authors\cb1 . Then I will turn my attention to the specific language of these works. I may use combinatorial n-gram matching to trace quotations and references, seeking intertextual relationships between my key authors and their peers. I may also employ statistical stylometric analysis to explore characteristic features of the\cb3 ir language-- especially those features that mark any the\cb1 m as outliers.}

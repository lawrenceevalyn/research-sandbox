\f0\fs22 \cf0 The conclusion I draw from that is 20% "so let's make sure we research things like the family joke in Northanger about the name Richard"\
And 80%: All\'a0reading\'a0is a collaboration! So when you read something, especially when you're a wee student and you're handed some monument of Literature to read, that's not actually a one-way full of Great Knowledge from the Great Author to you, that's a process that you have a share in, and you probably want to put some work in to make yourself a\'a0good\'a0reader (see: my struggles with sci fi and noir), but you also have the power to choose a mode of reading that works for you, that gives you things you want out of the literature (reparative reading!)}

\f0\fs22 \cf0 I would be really interested to know each character's ratio for being the source vs the target of speech -- how much more does Hamlet talk to others than they talk to him? How does he compare to everybody else? This seems really easy to calculate from the information already found, I just never thought to look at it until the student's thesis mentioned Hamlet's in-degree and out-degree numbers.}

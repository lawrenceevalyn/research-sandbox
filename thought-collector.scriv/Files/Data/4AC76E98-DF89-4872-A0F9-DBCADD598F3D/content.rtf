\'93Digital humanities\'94 is often figured as a historical rupture of its own, one which calls into question past literary study and makes the future of the field impossible to predict. Adam Hammond uses his monograph to try to grasp the nature of the changes; more commonly, book-length criticism in the digital humanities take the form of edited collections, which accumulate many small snapshots of computationally-engaged research that only rarely attempt to theorize the whole. There are often common threads between these local strategies to maintain humanist and qualitative principles within individual computation projects, but even these are often seen as representing an intermediate stage. Bettina Fischer-Starke\'92s linguistics monograph, being totally embedded in the computational corpus analysis which now constitute linguistics itself as a field, presents an illuminating contrast to the hestitations and preoccupation with definitions and boundaries in self-identified \'93digital humanities\'94 work.}

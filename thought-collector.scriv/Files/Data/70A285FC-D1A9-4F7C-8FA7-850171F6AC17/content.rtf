Does a work get listed according it its composition? (Beginning of first composition, or end of last revision?) Its first publication? But \'93publication\'94 doesn\'92t apply to works that circulated widely in manuscript form \'97 date from the first time a copy was \'93distributed\'94 to someone other than the author? (What about, e.g., Percy editing Frankenstein? Other manuscript works were surely revised in response to feedback, but Mary giving Percy a copy doesn\'92t feel like \'93publication\'94.)\
Beginning of first composition is probably easiest (though still not easy) to actually pin to a fixed moment, but work change so much over the course of composition that the chronological conclusions drawn from this arrangement aren\'92t likely to be fully useful. I like first publication to reflect when the work became less inchoate and entered into a broader literary conversation \'97 this is the point at which chronological connections seem most likely to be informative.}

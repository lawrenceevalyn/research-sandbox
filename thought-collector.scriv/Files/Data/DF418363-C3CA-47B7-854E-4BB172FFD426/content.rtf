\f0\fs22 \cf0 Reading Wolfenbach, Emmeline, Coelebs, and now Clermont, I have been impressed again and again by the importance of, hm, women's duplicity? The strategic use of emotion/affect, and the even more strategic use of vulnerability, as a way to control men and thus enact desirable change upon the world. There is spooky window dressing and a couple shocking secrets in these Gothics so far, but they are also deeply embedded in non-supernatural, non-Gothically-aestheticized problems of female powerlessness. I want to read more about the sentimental nove;: it seems like there is a really direct line form there to Radcliffe.}

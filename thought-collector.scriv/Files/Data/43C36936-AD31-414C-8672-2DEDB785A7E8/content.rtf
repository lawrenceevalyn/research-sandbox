Jo Walton\'92s \'93single most quoted thing I have ever written\'94 is a song \'93The Lurkers Support Me In Email\'94 to the tune of \'93My Bonny Lies Over The Ocean\'94 \'97 because the tune makes the words more memorable, so if the idea itself sticks with you you now have a pre-packaged way to share it\

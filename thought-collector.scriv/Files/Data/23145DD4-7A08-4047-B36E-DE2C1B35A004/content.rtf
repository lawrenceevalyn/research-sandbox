\f0\fs22 \cf0 I am not sure\'a0what\'a0I now know about Charlotte Smith that I didn't before, but I feel like I know\'a0something. Mostly, I think, spreading all these poems out in my timeline helps to clarify that\'a0Elegiac Sonnets\'a0(like Tristram Shandy!) is not actually a single unified work representing one moment of time, but rather an assemblage that can react to the events it shapes. The re-introduction of chronological gaps makes it easier to identify where she is developing her thoughts or changing her mind, and highlights the trial-and-error of her experiments as sets of poems are entered into the record.}

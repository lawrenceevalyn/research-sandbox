\f0\fs22 \cf0 The reading experience of \'93living with\'94 Udolpho is so different from \'93living with\'94 Tristram or Waverley; the naysayers aren\'92t wrong about the emotional impact of the narrative, and really the think Waverley does with the Gothic isn\'92t making it respectable but defanging it. (Or perhaps, defanging it is what makes it respectable? Intellectual distance now instead of emotional and personal impact?)\

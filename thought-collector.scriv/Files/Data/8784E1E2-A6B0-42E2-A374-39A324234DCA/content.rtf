Computational work in the humanities often comes with a false veneer of empirical objectivity, but I think this is due in part to the fact that, as McCarty notes, research in other fields is hard even to identify *as* research. These things are not taken as exact or objective in computer science; they are just framed in such a way that humanists don\'92t easily understand the CS disclaimers.}

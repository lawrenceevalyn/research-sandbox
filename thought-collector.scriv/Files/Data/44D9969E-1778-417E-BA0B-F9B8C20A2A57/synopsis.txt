 Problem Statement (or Motivation for the Study) – Identify a key point of concern (for example, increasing use or prominence, lack of research to date, response to an agenda, a new discovery, or perhaps one not yet applied to this context). – Refer to the literature only to the extent needed to demonstrate why your project is worth doing. Reserve your full review of existing theory or practice for later chapters. – Be sure that the motivation, or problem, suggests a need for further investigation.

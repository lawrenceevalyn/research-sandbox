\f0\fs22 \cf0 It\'92s buying into Wordsworth\'92s weird aesthetic fetishization of poverty to say that a poor old man is defined by his struggle with a root and has nothing left after the wandering poet slices it for him. There is another root. There are a lot more roots. There are also clothes to wash and furniture to mend and a thousand, thousand other household labours, which his wife has been doing! If anything, the sadness of his gratitude is that, as the poet knows, cutting one root does nothing to change the actual condition of the man\'92s life.}

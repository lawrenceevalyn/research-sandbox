\f0\fs22 \cf0 It does sometimes feel like I will have no idea what I'm talking about until I've read a hundred 18thC novels... I should make a list of what I've actually rolled my eyes past, and think about some habits of, e.g., using ReadMe! to speed-read more of these. I find that I get a lot out of even a very superficial read of the works as a whole.}

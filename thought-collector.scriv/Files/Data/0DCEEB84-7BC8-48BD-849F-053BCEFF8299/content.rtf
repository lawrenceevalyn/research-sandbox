\f0\fs22 \cf0 The parser uses stage directions to break the play into \'91blocks\'92. Each block represents a section of the play during which a set of characters are on stage together. Whenever the parser encounters a stage direction, it parses that direction to determine whether it includes a character entrance or exit and thus demarcates a new block. Within each block, the parser uses speaker tags and parsed stage directions to determine who is on stage for that block, and keeps a running tally of how many words each character has spoken. At the end of the block, the connections within that block are recorded and the next block begun.}

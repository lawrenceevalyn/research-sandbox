\f0\fs22 \cf0 The decade 1789-99, according to the ESTC corpus, is driven by publishers at least as much as it is by authors. At this scale, no one author can be seen to have particular impact. Even Paine, and More, and Wesley are dwarfed by the volume of work produced by \'93Great Britain\'94, and dwarfed again by the works by \'93null\'94 authors who were not only unsigned at the time but elude bibliographic documentation now.}

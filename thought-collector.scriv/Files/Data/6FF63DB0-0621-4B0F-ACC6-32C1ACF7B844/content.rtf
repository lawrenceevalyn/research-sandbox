\f0\fs22 \cf0 People often react to computational experiments by saying \'91oh, we already knew that\'92 \'97 but I think (as per Underwood\'92s tweet) that they are often overestimating their prior knowledge based on the fact that the experimental result accords with the incomplete prior knowledge that they DID have\'85. But we SHOULD expect that an experimental result, if it\'92s true, will roughly agree with the knowledge we\'92ve acquired via other means!}

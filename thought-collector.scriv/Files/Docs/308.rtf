In Radcliffe you know who the heroine should marry; the mysteries are all cosmetic (though there\'92s always the slight chance that she will die before the end and someone else will marry the nice gentleman); in Austen, the stories are all high-stakes mysteries that puts the reader in the same shoes as the heroine-investigator as she tries to figure out who is a good person for her to marry.}

As someone who left my home country to ensure my personal comfort and safety in response to an unacceptable political status quo, albeit in the most financially comfortable way possible, I feel a watered-down kinship with the situation of the French emigr\'e9s. Actual refugees are of course the more direct comparison to draw, given the very direct nature of the violence being fled in France, except that like the emigr\'e9s and unlike a refugee I have been able to comfortably make a quiet living off the \'91accomplishments\'92 I naturally acquired during my wealthy upbringing.}

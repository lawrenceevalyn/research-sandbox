As 18thC writers themselves often found, it is much easier to expose the flaws in a particular mode of thinking than it is to articulate a viable alternative. I want to resist the above simplified narrative of the period; I want to resist the \'93parade of authors\'94 ways of understanding the period; I would also like to resist the \'93parliament of authors\'94 mode, though I may have to give in to that one; I think exhaustive particularty might be my way out.}

Alan Liu, _Wordsworth: The Sense of History_: this is an extraordinary, although quite difficult book. On its surface, it's a New Historicist account of Wordsworth's poetry. However, I've learned more about aesthetics in general from this book than from most other Romanticist criticism. (For one of many, many examples in this book, see Liu's brilliant discussion of "atmosphere" in landscape painting and poetry from essentially the Middle Ages to Wordsworth in his chapter on Wordsworth and the picturesque--in a few brief pages, one gets an incredibly helpful art history account that also illuminates Wordsworth's poetry)}

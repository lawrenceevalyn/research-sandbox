<p class="itemTitle">debt vs credit</p>
<p class="itemText">It has JUST occurred to me that, in an odd counterpoint to all the 18thC wailing about commerce and debt as destructive of social institutions, etc etc, actually nearly every nobleman depicted across everything I’ve read makes judicious use of financial credit</p>
<p class="itemText">It’s a classic move for a man to, say, crawl out of the channel after a shipwreck and turn up at the nearest peasant and say “as you can see I am a gentleman in temporary distress, help me and I’ll pay you back” (sometimes not even needing...</p>

<p class="itemText">The comfort, in Barbauld’s imagining, is that the ruined buildings will still be imaginatively occupied by a veritable flood of still-remembered named individuals who constitute a national legacy; a much more soothing image than Smith’s, in which the buildings are unreadable</p>

<p class="itemTitle">critics are right: Gothics make you anxious</p>
<p class="itemText">The reading experience of “living with” Udolpho is so different from “living with” Tristram or Waverley; the naysayers aren’t wrong about the emotional impact of the narrative, and really the think Waverley does with the Gothic isn’t making it respectable but defanging it. (Or perhaps, defanging it is what makes it respectable? Intellectual distance now instead of emotional and personal impact?)</p>

<p class="itemText">People often react to computational experiments by saying ‘oh, we already knew that’ — but I think (as per Underwood’s tweet) that they are often overestimating their prior knowledge based on the fact that the experimental result accords with the incomplete prior knowledge that they DID have…. But we SHOULD expect that an experimental result, if it’s true, will roughly agree with the knowledge we’ve acquired via other means!</p>
